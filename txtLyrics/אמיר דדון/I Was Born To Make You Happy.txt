I'm sitting here alone up in my room 
and thinking about the times that we've been through 
(oh my love) 
I'm looking at a picture in my hand 
Trying my best to understand 
I really wanna know what we did wrong 
with a love that felt so strong 
I know that we could make it right 
I don't know how to live without your love 
I was born to make you happy 
Always and forever you and me 
That's the way our life should be 
I don't know how to live without your love 
I was born to make you happy 
I don't know how to live without your love 
I was born to make you happy 
Always and forever you and me 
That's the way our life should be 
I don't know how to live without your love 
I was born to make you happy
