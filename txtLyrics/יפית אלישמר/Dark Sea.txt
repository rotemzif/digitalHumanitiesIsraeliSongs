Last night I dreamt
That I was drowning in a deep blue ocean
Currents carry me far away from shore
Not sure what to do or how to move- I let myself be swept away *2
Course: into the belly of a great blue giant
Closed my eyes and said a silent prayer
Into the belly of a great blue giant- closed my eyes and said a prayer
Woke up while waves caressed my body
Was thrown away
By the angry sea
And I was safe now
Until another wave
Will carry me back to the dark sea
Course: into the belly of a great blue giant
Closed my eyes and said a silent prayer
Into the belly of a great blue giant- closed my eyes and said a prayer
Last night a felt that I was drowning in a deep blue sea
