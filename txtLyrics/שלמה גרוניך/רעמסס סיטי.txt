When you go to Ramses City
Bring your head on top (of) your shoulders
In Ramses City 
Nobody will say hello to you
.If you come without your head
They'll say: "Get them out of our land!"
They'll say: "Get them out of our treasure city"!
But if you find the way to Ramses City
They cut off your head for you
and you will say: Thanks.
And you won't see the city anymore.
Take me down to Ramses City
Wanna see the wretched happy
In Ramses City
Nobody can see the moon at night
No one will live
No one will die.
When you go to Ramses City
Pack your life and bring it with you
In Ramses City 
Nobody will say hello to you
.If you come without your life
They'll say: "Get them out of our land!"
They'll say: "Get them out of our treasure city"!
But if you bring your soul to Ramses City
They will make it black for you
and you will say: Thanks.
And you won't leave the city anymore.
Take me down to Ramses City
Wanna see the wretched happy
In Ramses City
Nobody can see the moon at night
No one will live
No one will die.
When you go to Ramses City
Wear your golden chains anround you
In Ramses City 
Nobody will say hello to you
.If you come without your chains
They'll say: "Get them out of our land!"
They'll say: "Get them out of our treasure city"!
But if you bring your chains to Ramses City
They'll chain you to the door
and you will say: Thanks.
And you won't walk in freedom anymore
Take me down to Ramses City
Wanna see the wretched happy
In Ramses City
Nobody can see the moon at night
No one will live
No one will die.
