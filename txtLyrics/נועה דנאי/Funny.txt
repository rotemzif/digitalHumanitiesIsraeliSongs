Funny! !
Music and Lyrics: Michal Geva 
I know that it sounds so funny but I am sad
I am sad
I know that it sounds like I want to be known
but I know I’m there 
you think that I’m thinking too deep 
but maybe I’ve lost my silence
call me anytime
I’m claiming whats mine
I’m claiming you
but its fun fun fun funny
fun funny oh no
fun fun fun funny
fun funny oh no its funny oh I love you
fun fun funny oh my you’re the one I chose
I know why, its easy to climb all the way up
I know that it sounds so easy but it’s not 
it’s not
I know that it looks like I want to be alone 
but I’m not 
you think that I’m crazy but sweet
but maybe I’ve lost my guidance 
call me anytime 
I’m claiming whats mine
I’m claiming you 
but its fun fun fun funny
fun funny oh no
fun fun fun funny
fun funny oh no its funny oh I love you
fun fun funny oh my you’re the one I chose
I know why, its easy to climb all the way up
Ah... Ah... 
Fun fun fun funny fun funny oh no...Oh...
fun fun funny fun funny oh no...
