I want you to see
How it comes to be
.That I'm down on my knees again
.Eyes look to the sky
No one told me why
.he doesn't look back at all
Woke up and I walked the wire.
Soak up the pain and say goodbye.
Catch the wind, I'll make it sing
Like a bird inside a cage.
.My eyes soon will dry
.Teach me how to fly
.Although I could never try
.I'm cold to the bone
.My tree's never grown
.But now I'm begging you, take me home
.Woke up and I walked the wire
.Soak up the pain and say goodbye
Catch the wind, I'll make it sing
Like a bird inside a cage.
