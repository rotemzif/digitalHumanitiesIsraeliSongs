Hard to know 
If it's going to pass 
Your eyes completing rounds 
Of full circles in the air 
I see you're headed to the mid town fair 
It grows on your spirit 
Central stage everywhere 
Make it last 
I'll take a train 
And ride it down 
You'll take off and lose the ground 
Will we find it again? 
Hard to wait 
When it's getting too late 
Your eyes completing rounds 
Back stage image, no one there 
Hard to stay 
When I've been gone away 
My mind completing round 
Two-way passage on display 
Make it last 
I have my doubts 
You have your fears 
We'll make a date to disappear 
Will we find us again
