This year's parade 
I came wearing my skin to trade 
And all my thoughts to the higher bid 
Myself intentions to a stranger in a street 
This year's parade 
Waiting for the time to fade 
Heaven knows to my disgrace 
Yourself reflections , are so hard to trace 
Looking for a crown to fit 
I'll hang my head down 
I see confusion got you to quit 
And you have no idea, 
If you've been lost or found 
On this year's parade 
This year's parade 
Got my sadness in a box to stay 
You've cut your strings, 
And flow a way 
Heaven knows, 
I had no words to say 
Looking for a crown to fit...
