When you lost the road
And gained a highway
Blue bound
That's where they found you
Running down
Running round
Take this road
You've got to keep it moving
You've got to sing this song
Though you might be losing
Everyone you know
It's the damned and the cursed 
It's the living art of dying
How can I explain this to you?
You're on your own
And nothing's planned
You better make a stand
Go on and kill that band
Kill the man
Blue bound
Wasting their time
The hour you find
Nothing makes a difference
