Oh, let me take you down this way 
In the first light I will sing and play 
It's like a shadow that I'm coming in this time 
And there's no reason to leave this love behind 
Oh, let me fill the night in day 
Under the moonlight I will sing and play 
It's almost like flying, 
That you're coming in this time 
And there's no denying the happiness I find 
In loving you 
Now that I've got all my beliefs and rhymes 
Tell me what you need 
Now I know, 
Where this road leads 
I know that I'll meet 
I know that it takes me 
Down to you 
Oh, silence eases my soul again 
If we'll be quiet, 
We could remain the same 
It's like a whisper that we're coming in this time 
And there's no more crying 
The weeping days are done 
Oh, let me keep the night and you 
In the sunlight, will it still be true 
I feel like you're sliding, 
And going on your way 
But there's no use in trying 
To change my constant way 
Of loving you
