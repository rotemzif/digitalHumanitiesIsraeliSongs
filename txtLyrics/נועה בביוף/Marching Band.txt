It's been too much time 
To write this song 
I've been a way 
I've been gone 
But I think this time I'll change my way 
I think I'll write a song today 
I think I'll lose 
When we first met, 
I think you knew, 
It could be bad, or it could be you 
That will change the way I use to feel 
Two marching bands up on the hill 
I think I'll play 
But if I leave in the summer 
And green turns brown 
Heat turns cold 
It takes time to see the gold 
Sad times, 
Loving you 
Spent too much time 
Being afraid, 
I used to stare, I used to wait 
But I think this time I'll have my days 
With northern lights, crystal nights and stay 
Above the blue 
It could be late, 
But here's my song 
When I get back will you be home 
'Cause I think I've changed my way 
But I still feel, 
That two marching bands are better than to kill 
One man's band 
Sad times 
Are leaving you
