I thought when it was over
That we were fine
I thought that you were a friend of mine
I thought of this all over again
You held my hand
That was alright
We've talked from darkness
Till there was light
I thought I'd crossed the border, again   
We can't escape our nights
Our days, our dreams
You'll take sleeping pills
And tell me how it feels
And I'm trying not constantly to be sad
The words you tell me
Run through my head
I've tried to get closer to you
We can't escape our nights
Our days, our dreams
I'll take sleeping pills
And tell you how it feels
