I think often of you, I hope you're feeling better. 
It's been hard for me, getting it together. 
We live in different rooms. You said yours is getting smaller. I bet you're lying there with all your typical anger. 
But wonderful things will come your way. Flowers like you've dreamed , will grow in your hair. And your bitter tears will have honey flowing in between. You'll stay like we played. My indian queen. 
It's so quiet now, and I'm remembering your crazy talking. You wanted to take the last train, just because you had no idea where it was going. 
Now we live in different rooms. You said yours is getting smaller. I bet you're lying there, waiting for the final closure. 
But wonderful things will come your way. Flowers like you've dreamed , will grow in your hair. And your bitter tears will have honey flowing in between. You'll stay like we played. My indian queen
