Them that are writing these songs, 
Keeping far distance at home 
Keeping the words that I wanted to say 
Turned to a secret today, 
Soon I'll be on my way 
She who had wrote what I feel 
Keeping my thoughts there to steal 
And into her music she weaves in sorrow and pain 
And in golden letters my name, 
And in smaller letters my shame 
Words craft, children's stories, and time 
Kept in arrangements and rhymes 
And inside the music 
I had no one to blame 
Nor voice or spirit to claim 
No points of courage to gain 
Them that are writing theses songs 
Keep out the flesh, leave the bones 
Keeping the words that I wanted to say 
Kept as a secret they'll stay 
Out of reach distance a way
