When I go, 
You'll write a song for me 
Now the words come out so easily 
You've kept them locked, 
But now you see 
That what you've known, 
Has changed in just one day, 
Oh the one you thought was here to stay 
Turned feather clouds of yesterday 
I'm taking time 
I have to make it mine 
I'll take the time 
I'll go a way to find you 
When it will be over, 
I'll come to you again 
When my words get broken, 
Nothing is true to me 
That's how I'll know 
What's right or wrong for me 
Sleeping days won't set me free 
I'll find a way, so I could be 
Taking the time 
I have to make it mine 
I'll take the time 
I'll find myself, 
To find you.
