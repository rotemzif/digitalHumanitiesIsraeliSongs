I burn bridges, 
As quickly as I burn myself 
I use to run, run, run, 
Without making one step 
Words come slower, 
As you lose the race 
They took you down, down, down 
But you've never looked back 
It's not what it means , 
It's not the way it should sound 
It's the world on your shoulder, 
That you carry around 
Well, you rode out 
I tried to love you right, 
But I failed again 
You felt the same 
And it's just another night 
Your light, 
Is running low
