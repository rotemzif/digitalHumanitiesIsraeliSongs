See them all a round you 
At your death 
How great, how kind 
What a sweet death poet 
He was 
And I have always loved you 
Strange love, some might say 
All I do, turns to blue 
This is not my song 
For you 
At your death 
She will come with her baby 
With a different Dady and sigh 
Women with sparks 
So clear and dark 
Who've played with your brain 
Will fade with the rain 
At your death 
Life will be simple again 
And though it's just illusion 
That you're over and gone 
While I pray 
Still you say, sing this song for me 
At your death,.. 
Life will be simple again
