It's funny when I called 
You were at the angels fall 
You said I play my guitar 
As if it had cotton strings 
Cotton wings 
Cotton hymns 
You cannot win 
With cotton dreams 
But I count my ways 
I count my days 
I write as lace 
There're holes in my poetry 
I sing it loud 
I play with doubt 
Oh, well I still count your ways of loving me 
And I find hard to confess 
I'm oblivion first lady 
And I play my heart on that cotton string 
I keep it hid 
Just like you did 
I had to lead my mind that way 
'Cause I count my ways 
I count my days 
I write as lace 
There're holes in my poetry 
But you've taken my heart away 
And it's a lonely tune six cotton strings 
Will play
