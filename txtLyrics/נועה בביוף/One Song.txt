One song 
Makes it harder for you 
Oh can't you see 
You are my best in time 
One place 
Makes it further for you 
Oh can't you see 
We're in the same back line 
And I'm taping my confusion 
And writing on the walls 
I'm painting my illusion 
So I won't have to call you, call you 
Time after time 
One touch 
Your shoulder trembles inside 
Oh what use to be 
Won't come again in time 
One tune 
You're dancing 
Crimson and blue 
Oh the black you see 
Once was pure gold of mine 
And I'm taping my confusion 
And writing on the walls 
I'm painting my illusion 
So I won't have to need you, need you 
Time after time
