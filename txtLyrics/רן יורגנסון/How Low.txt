i know you wanted me to go 
pretend to smile as if you know 
and even if you'll point the door 
i'll stick around, 
i'm in control 
so take my hand 
i'll show you just how low can you go 
commit myself to be the strong 
and on my way i see no one 
cause even when your blood will flow 
i never cared 
i'll never stop 
so take my hand 
i'll show you just how low can you go
