grey when your wind blow 
came from a distant home 
and it's so real 
i won't let go 
so don't be scared 
you know where we belong 
outside the wind blows 
the real storm is inside 
trust in fear 
hurt me now 
go 
don't look back 
don't ask why 
i won't let you down 
so turn around 
and go 
alone your wind blew 
and went too far 
and it's so real i won't let go 
so don't be scared 
you know where we belong 
outside the wind blows 
the real storm is inside 
black as a widow 
why? 
i need you now 
trust in fear 
hurt me now 
go 
don't look back 
don't ask why 
i won't let you down 
so turn around 
i won't let you down 
so turn around 
and go
