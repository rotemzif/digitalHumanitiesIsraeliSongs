i'll have my party alone today 
who cares anyway 
i don't need them now 
who wants presents with pretty gloss? 
who wants party cloths? 
i don't need them now 
can i turn the lights? 
can i cut the cake? 
a wish is just a wish 
what difference does it make? 
now that everyone's gathered here 
sing out loud and clear 
cheerful as can be, 
happy birthday to me 
can i turn the lights?... 
now that everyone's gathered here...
