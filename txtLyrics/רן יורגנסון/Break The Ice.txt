traces in the sand 
i can hear you walk behind me 
faces in my head 
their eyes are melting slowly 
so break the ice 
don't keep me waiting for so long 
tell me why 
and i will never let you go 
all you need to say 
all your thoughts and fears surround me 
like an empty page 
spread around for you to write me 
so break the ice... 
alone 
so make a sign 
let me know i'm not alone in this round 
make a sound 
take your chance because i'm here for you now 
tell me what's on your mind 
how you understand 
how you look so good around me 
never run away 
when my demons come to haunt me 
so break the ice... 
alone
