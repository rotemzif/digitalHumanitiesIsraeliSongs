now it's taking over me 
after all the things you said 
have you ever taken us for granted? 
if you had a second chance 
will you make the same mistakes? 
stay and there will never be another 
every time, everywhere 
teardrops flow between us 
silence screams inside us 
everything that i am 
you can make it better 
you can take it further 
now it's taking over me 
so much love and so much pain 
like a flame that bursts inside deep water 
can you really understand? 
do you want to face your fear? 
there is hell inside our little heaven 
every time, everywhere... 
now it's taking over me 
you will never understand 
how my feelings blown away to pieces 
something dies inside of me 
words are meaningless again 
for this day will stay with me forever
