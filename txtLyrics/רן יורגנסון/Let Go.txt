when words are not enough 
and sadness 
takes all 
i want to tear your flesh 
get inside 
kiss your soul 
because we hanged it so high 
now it's out of reach 
because we never knew 
while lost the ground beneath 
beneath 
and as the days go on 
i'm hunted when i sleep 
to feel it one more time 
come, 
dive in way too deep 
too deep 
when words are not enough...
