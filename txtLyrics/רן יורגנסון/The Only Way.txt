wanted you so bad 
completely lost my head 
there is no more turning back 
what's said is said 
have to run away 
hurt myself the only way 
you made me disappear 
you made me prey 
even now 
after all 
you're forgiven 
i can't go on 
never realized 
everything's gone 
and even now 
words can say how i feel 
but i'll always hide it so far inside 
always cry inside 
wanted you so bad 
completely lost my head 
there is no more turning back 
what's said is said 
have to run away 
hurt myself the only way 
you made me disappear 
you made me. 
have to run away 
hurt myself the only way 
you made me disappear 
you made me fade away 
even now...
