walk around the bed with this sound in my head 
doesn't really matter 
today 
everything's in place 
nothing left here to say 
i don't see a reason to stay 
smile 'cause i need to scream 
when i had to find myself once again 
(tomorrow you'll be crying) 
everything's falling 
everyone's fading 
here in my head 
sitting on the bed 
hold my life in my hand 
thinking of tomorrow again 
everything i do gives you trouble and pain 
know that you were always my friend 
smile 'cause i need to scream 
when i had to find myself once again 
(tomorrow you'll be crying) 
everything's falling 
everyone's fading 
here in my head 
laying on the bed with this sound in my head 
doesn't really matter 
today 
everything's in place 
nothing left here to say 
i don't see a reason to stay 
smile 'cause i need to scream 
when i had to find myself once again 
everything's falling 
everyone's fading 
here in my head 
(tomorrow you'll be crying) 
smile when i need to scream 
now i have to find myself once again 
(tomorrow you'll be crying) 
my head is bleeding 
everything's fading 
here in my bed
