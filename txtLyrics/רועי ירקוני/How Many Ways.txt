How many ways are there, you ask
How many ways are there, you ask
The tortoise who tries always
The tortoise who tries always
To move forward even when
Heavy rocks block your path
Every one of the women you loved
Might have brought you joy
Had you known how to turn from the rocks
But what if you went many ways
And lose the trail you should have made
But what if you went many ways
And lose the trail you should have made
Moving forward even when
Memories call out your name
Every one of the women you loved
Might have brought you joy
Had you known how to turn from the rocks
Sometimes only the pressure of your head against them
Drove them to pace like animals in cages
Back and forth
Back and forth
Back and forth
