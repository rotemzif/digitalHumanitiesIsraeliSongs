I found my husband, husband
I found a guy i want to marry to
He'll be my husband, husband
The father of my kids,
I think we will have two.
I met my husband, husband
I fell in love, I'll take him home with me
He'll be my husband, husband
my lover and my friend
and all I need.
Now that I found you
You'll never go away
Never ever go away
I found my husband, husbandâ€¦
