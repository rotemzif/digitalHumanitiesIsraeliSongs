Everybody's down today and I think that I know why 
There's some smoke up in their eyes 
Everybody's drunk today and I think that I know why 
There's a girl and she is shy 
And she says 
When the sun can't have its way 
I know I'll be 
the queen of the sky 
Where the sun can't send its rays 
I know I'm gonna stay for a while 
New beginnings keep on spinning 
down from my bathroom floor 
I've got all but she wants more 
She wants the stars and the moon and 
the sun and G-d himself 
And that's all that I have left 
But I say When the 
sun can't have its way 
I know I'll be the queen of the sky 
Where the sun can't send its rays 
I know I'm gonna stay for a while
