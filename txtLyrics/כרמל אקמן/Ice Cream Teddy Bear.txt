Stay little darling 
you've come a long way from home
You’ve been walking for hours 
leaving footprints in the snow
Climb, don’t be running away from
Me, I keep running away 'cause
It's over and done 
you must turn around
There's nothing for you girl
it always been that way 
take your steps back into your own bed.
