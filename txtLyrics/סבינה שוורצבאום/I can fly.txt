I was lying in my bed
I was dreaming about us
Can you imagine
No more fears
I was lying in my bed
I was dreaming about us
Can you imagine
No more tears,
No more fears
Chorus:
I CAN FLY
I CAN FLY
YOU CAN FLY
WE CAN FLY
Stars are shining on this planet
Reaching out to all the people
Can you imagine
we are one
Chorus:
I CAN FLY
I CAN FLY
YOU CAN FLY
WE CAN FLY
C-part
Chorus:#2
