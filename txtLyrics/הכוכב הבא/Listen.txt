Listen to the song here in my heart 
A melody I start but cant complete 
Listen to the sound from deep within 
It's only beginning to find release 
Oh the time has come for my dreams to be heard 
They will not be pushed aside and turned 
Into your own all cause you wont listen 
Listen I am alone at a crossroad 
I'm not at home in my own home 
And I've tried and tried to say whats on my mind 
You should have known 
Now I'm done believing you 
You dont know what I'm feeling 
I'm more than what you made of me 
I followed the voice you gave to me 
But now I've gotta find my own 
There is someone here inside 
Someone I thought had died so long ago 
Oh Im screaming out and my dream to be heard 
They will not be pushed aside or burned 
Into your own all 'cause you won't listen 
Listen, I am alone at a crossroad 
I'm not at home in my own home 
And I've tried and tried to say whats on my mind 
You should have know 
Oh now I'm done believing you 
You don't know what I'm feeling 
I'm more than what you made of me 
I followed the voice you gave to me 
But now I've gotta find my own
