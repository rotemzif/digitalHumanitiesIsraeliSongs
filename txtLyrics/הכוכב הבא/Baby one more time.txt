Oh  baby baby
How was I supposed to know 
That something wasn't right here
Oh  baby  baby
I shouldn't have let you go 
And now you're out of sight yeah 
Show me 
How you want it to be 
Tell me baby 
Cause I need to know now 
Oh because 
My loneliness is killing me 
I must confess 
I still believe 
When I'm not with you I lose my mind 
Give me a sign 
Hit me baby one more time 
Oh  baby baby
The reason I breathe is you 
Boy  you've got me blinded 
Oh pretty baby there's nothing that I wouldn't do 
It's not the way I planned it 
I must confess 
That my loneliness 
Is killing me now 
Don't you know I still believe 
That you will be here and give me a sign 
Hit me baby one more time 
My loneliness is killing me 
I must confess 
I still believe 
When I'm not with you I lose my mind 
Give me a sign 
My loneliness is killing me 
I must confess 
I still believe 
When I'm not with you I lose my mind 
Give me a sign
Hit me baby 
One more time 
Hit me baby 
One more time 
Hit me baby 
One more time 
One more time 
Hit me baby 
One more time 
Oh  baby baby
How was I supposed to know 
That something wasn't right here
Oh pretty baby there's
 nothing that I wouldn't do 
It's not the way I planned it
