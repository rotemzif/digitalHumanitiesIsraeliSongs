I remember when 
I remember I remember when I lost my mind 
There was something so pleasant about that phase 
Even your emotions had an echo 
And so much space 
And when you're out there 
Without care 
Yeah I was out of touch 
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough 
I just knew too much 
Does that make me crazy 
Does that make me crazy 
Does that make me crazy 
Probably 
And I hope that you are having the time of your life 
But think twice 
Thats my only advice 
Come on now 
Who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are 
Ha ha ha
Bless your soul 
You really think you're in control 
Well 
I think you're crazy 
I think you're crazy 
I think you're crazy 
Just like me 
maybe I'm crazy 
Maybe you're crazy 
Maybe we're crazy 
Probably  
 maybe I'm crazy 
Maybe you're crazy 
Maybe we're crazy 
Probably
