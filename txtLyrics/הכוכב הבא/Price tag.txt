Seems like everybody's got a price, 
I wonder how they sleep at night. 
When the sale comes first, 
And the truth comes second, 
Just stop, for a minute and 
Smile 
Why is everybody so serious! 
Acting so damn mysterious 
You got your shades on your eyes 
And your heels so high 
That you can't even have a good time. 
Everybody look to their left (yeah) 
Everybody look to their right (ha) 
Can you feel that (yeah) 
We're paying with love tonight 
It's not about the money, money, money 
We don't need your money, money, money 
We just wanna make the world dance, 
Forget about the Price Tag 
Ain't about the (uh) Cha-Ching Cha-Ching.

Wanna make the world dance,

We need to take it back in time, 
When music made us all UNITE! 
And it wasn't low blows and video hoes, 
Am I the only one gettin'... tired? 
Why is everybody so obsessed? 
Money can't buy us happiness 
Can we all slow down and enjoy right now 
Guarantee we'll be feeling Alright. 
Everybody look to their left (yeah)
