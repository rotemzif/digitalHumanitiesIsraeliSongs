Are the blonds taking over the world 
With their confidence and matching underwear 
Do the blonds glow in your bed 
Like a ray of light that shines inside your hand 
Look at me 
Look at me 
Can't you see 
You're too close you're too near 
Look at me 
Are the blonds taking over your head 
With their lipstick and their casual lies 
Would you care to swap for a brunette 
Just for one dark night in your bed 
Look at me 
Look at me 
Can't you see 
You're too close you're too near... 
Look at me 
Can't you see
