Can't seem to find what I'm looking for 
Can't feel beautiful 
Paper girls are falling from the sky 
Flesh is empty 
A girl is light 
Skinny like the air 
Steam my essence 
Too bad that I'm here to stay and I've got presence 
Hey girl you know you're beautiful 
You hold creation 
Hey boy scared of a tiger girl 
Come and catch me 
I'm scared to win 
So scared of what's inside 
Lady be limited 
You lied you said that girls were weak 
But I am stronger 
Inside a burning beat 
Mother triumphs 
Hey girl you know you're beautiful 
You hold creation 
Hey boy scared of a tiger girl 
Come and catch me 
Hey girl you know you're beautiful 
You hold creation 
Hey boy scared of a tiger girl 
Shocked just watch me 
Inside it lies what I'm looking for 
Embrace my body I free my soul
