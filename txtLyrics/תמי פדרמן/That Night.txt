You say you never meant to hurt me 
So what were you thinking of that night 
When shadows turn to haunt me 
I can't stop the fire in my heart 
Why is it the closer we get 
The more it hurts inside 
And when it's over tell me 
Will you even cry for us 
You said that I'm the only thing that mattered So how could you just change your mind 
And I thought you were my best friend 
But you donâ€™t even know me 
This isn't right 
Why is it the closer we get 
The more it hurts inside 
And when it's over 
Will you even cry for me 
You said you never meant to hurt me 
So what were you thinking of that night 
When shadows turn to haunt me 
Then I stop the fire in my heart
