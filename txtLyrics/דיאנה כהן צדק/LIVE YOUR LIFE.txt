Silence around,
it’s getting dark again
Head full of dreams of sweet success
Feeling so sure you can do anything
,Soon it will come
life just begins
,Believe it
,you can do it
,Envision it
receive the light
,Live it
trust your feelings
,See it
.it' so bright
:Chorus
,Live your life
follow the dreams in your heart
Feel the passion each moment
,Live your life
get closer each day to the top
Fulﬁll your dream
,One more sleepless night
feeling excited
Close is the day to reach the goal
,Emotions are strong
eyes are shining
,Soon it will come
,feel the joy
,Believe it
you can do it
,Envision it
receive the light
,Live it
trust your feelings
,See it
.it' so bright
:Chorus
,Live your life
follow the dreams in your heart
Feel the passion each moment
,Live your life
,get closer each day to the top
.Fulﬁll your dream
