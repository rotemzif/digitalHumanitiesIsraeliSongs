Black. White. Black. White. 
Highway sheet four lanes wide 
Asphalt giants, snakes we ride 
Choose your snake and choose your side 
You stream under me 
Twisting, throwing the lights aside 
Were do you bring me? 
One of us will decide 
Endless way without a reason 
From the prison to the prison 
One of them is ours 
From The Gateway of the Hopeless 
To the ruins of the Fortress 
Eighty miles an hour 
Passed a road-sign with a warning 
Never been here. Flashing burning 
Thought: "Am I a prey here?" 
Shadow moves among th shadows 
Creeping void across the meadows 
Wish it wouldn't stay here 
Here again, alone and afraid 
The frightened voice from the radio said 
That someone's crushed and was found dead 
What are these bites on his head? 
We keep on going, we and our friends 
With usual loss every day ends 
And she shakes us into unconciousness 
Like some kind of Loch-Ness princess
