I never loved like this
I never loved like this
If this world still exists
Let it rain until it will explode to pieces
Like I do
When you told me it’s over
I thought that I’d never hit the floor
And oh, when you kept calling me each morning
I thought that I’d never need nothing more
I never loved like this
I never loved like this
If this world still exists
Let it rain until it will explode to pieces
Like I do
When you told me you love me
I thought I would never ask for more
And oh, Honey it’s the last time you drown us in your pain
Who's your love?
Who’s your love?
I never loved like this
I never loved like this
If this world still exists
Let it rain
Let it rain
Honey it’s the last time you drown us in those tunnels of your pain
who's your love?
who's your love?
