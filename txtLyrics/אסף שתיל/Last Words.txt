After fire came rain
Twirling us down the drain
There’s nothing to hold on to
Except these false hopes
That our love will carry us away
It’s a chronicle disease
How to pirouette the changing seas
Stretching your emotions
It’s always such a lonesome road
Never knowing the density of our gold
Oh, you’re a strange desire
You’re always around
You’re tripping me over
I’m attracted to your sound
We are traveling stars
Always looking for a hit and run
Maybe I still love you
But my love is full of holes
How do I know
That what I feel will last?
You and I, we don’t fit together
Still we get pulled like magnets into the floor
Skin verses skin, I can’t resist you
I don’t care if this is love
Cause It’s stronger then words
We’re headed for destruction
Losing all controls
We try to build on something
but everything gets ruined
one last time inside my arms
one last drink for closing time
one last time to kiss goodbye
one last time to close that door
and start all over
start all over
start all over
Oh you’re a strange desire
You’re always around
You’re tripping me over
I’m attracted to your sound
