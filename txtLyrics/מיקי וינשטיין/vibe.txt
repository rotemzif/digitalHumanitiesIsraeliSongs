If my love has been a nightmare
Let me wake you up tonight.
Let me hold you in my arms
And say, get out of my old flat,
If you're thinking that your beauty
Will pay half the bills tonight.
I am sorry to announce,
But I will get my self a vibe,
Let me say it clear my darling
I ain't leaving here tonight.
Cause I paid you with my body
And if this is not all right.
I have washed and dried Your dirty
Under cloths and mind.
Now I'll take you to the cleaners
Honey, there will be a fight.
If you're thinking that I'm worried
Baby, listen to this line,
It's been years that I have stashed
All my money out of town.
And the properties we own
I have tapped them to the top.
Well I think your ass is hanging,
Maybe you should get a vibe.
Well how funny that you mentioned
I have known it for a while,
Your accountant has been generous
He's been giving me "heads up".
He's been transferring your money
To my personal account,
Did I mentioned about the cleaners?!
Yes I did honey…………. Good luck!!
