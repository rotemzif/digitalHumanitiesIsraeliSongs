But I see your true colors shining through 
I see your true colors that's why I love you 
You with the sad eyes 
Don't be discouraged 
oh I realize 
It's hard to take courage 
In a world full of people 
You can lose sight of it 
And the darkness still inside you make you feel so small 
But I see your true colors shining through 
I see your true colors that's why I love you 
So don't be afraid to let them show 
Your true colors true colors 
Beautiful like a rainbow 
Show me your smile and 
Don't be unhappy can't remember when 
I last saw you laughing 
If this world makes you crazy 
And you've taken all you can bear 
you call me up because you know I'll be there 
And I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors and that's why I love you 
So don't be afraid to let them show 
True colors true colors 
Are beautiful like a rainbow 
true colors shining through
I see your true colors and that's why I love you 
So don't be afraid to let them show 
True colors true colors 
Are beautiful like a rainbow
