In the city no one knows your name. -- In the city, I’m so
glad you came.
Cause no one sees me when I go insane. -- Feeling freely,
climbing up into the sky. -- I will fly so high. -- Look below,
it all seems so small.
Kiss the sky, let the feeling flow, =-- Then go.
In the city, thought I heard you name. -- Loudly, clearly.., my
mistake.
Cause you can see me, so you can take me there. -- Then you
scream at me,
don’t you want the same. -- To the sky we will fly so high.
Take a fall, it all seems so small. -- Feel the sky,
please don’t let me go. -- Giant blow, I thought I have seen
it all.
Feel the sky, please don’t let me go.
