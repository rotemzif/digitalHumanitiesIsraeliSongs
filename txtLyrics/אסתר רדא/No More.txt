you used your violin to play me a love song
you painted a world so i could blossom
but now see thats just the thing
you use your loving bow just like a sting
no more not right now
never meant to read the notes under your crown
never meant to bring no truth to this lost town
its that fear that i've known left unloved and alone
no more i wont give you no chance to anchor
ill never be what you want me to be
thats just who i am
stop try to change me
i'm tired of this hiding game time to revel now
we live in storms created by fears
till the clouds move and the sun appears
well she sent a ray of light under my skin
