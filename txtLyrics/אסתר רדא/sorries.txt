sorries always come with warnings
not this not that
i've got nothing left
breath in i forgot to bring in
a smile for a while
might make you come in
heavy this load i way too ivy
no roads no wheels
smoke defines me
ache is what i feel inside
beside i'm blind can't see no change
and you know i've tried
i need your loving too wash it all away
lend me your shoulder i need a place to rest my head
you are the one who always say tomorrow is a new day
please stay
floating the memories are floating
got lost while searching in doubts i'm sinking
playing hide and seek with present
borders i always miss them
and future makes me afraid it
