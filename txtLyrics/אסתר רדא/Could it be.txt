could it be
that the stars covered my eyes
could it be
that i sew it all
could it be
that i heard the floor speaking
could it be
it spoke to the wall
could it be
that i've been here before
theres no other place i can go to
could it be
that you're flying with no wings
that i'm always right there with you
i'm feeling that i'm falling
can someone hold my hand
and show me how to stand
i'm loosing it again
i'm feeling that i'm falling
alone no helping friend
hope its not that time
i'll reach the end
could it be
this is not the first time we met
lost souls in a desert
could it be
that the moon touched my skin
is that the way love is measured
could it be
that your smile is my heart
and when you're sad i'm dying
could it be
that i've never felt in love
all my life i was actually lying
