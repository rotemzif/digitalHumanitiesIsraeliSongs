everyone got a piece of you
nothing left for me
professional thief
you stole my sleep
left me to wonder the streets
like a stalkless leaf
and even though 
you act like you don't know
i can hear that fear
deafen my ear
don't you blame it on me
sitting there with your head up high
nothing can harm you
professional man
life follow you're demands
but you failed to bury this head
in the sand
and even so
you act like you don't know
i can see that sore appear 
but i cant dry your hidden tears
so don't you blame it on me
i don't wanna hear anything from you
rolling around in familiar places 
nothing can teach you
professional boss
with an evil force
you wont stop making us feel worst
and like i said
i can make it on my own
i don't need you
i'm sure you can see
so don't you blame it on me
you're not my dad no one is
you can not teach me how pain feels
i don't wanna hear anything from you
