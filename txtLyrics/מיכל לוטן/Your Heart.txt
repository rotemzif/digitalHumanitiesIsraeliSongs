Following the birds 
to an isolated place 
But we're late 
Following the train 
to wherever it nmay go 
Which one will you 
ride today 
Your heart it's tired 
and cruel 
you don't know how 
to love 
But neither do i 
So stained 
So tired and cruel 
Say what you want 
Some day you shall awaken 
With heart for love 
Sing your old song 
of violence and shame 
I see you're gentle side 
Your heart it's tired 
and cruel 
you don't know how 
to love 
But neither do i 
So stained 
So tired and cruel 
Just for todaty 
Show me your heart
