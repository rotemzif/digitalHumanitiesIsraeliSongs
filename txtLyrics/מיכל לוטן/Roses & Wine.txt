Waiting 
I've waited for the longest time 
Waited for a million years 
Silhouetted 
It's lovely 
Lovely In the outer rime 
Lovely in the cooler scean 
I wasn't hoping to get in 
Here in the wrong places 
A big belly 
But a strong heart for the different mind 
I like my twisted ankle 
My bat of hearing 
In makes me feel my heart 
And my heart's made of roses and wine 
And itâ€™s so good 
So good to have you clear 
So good to have you near 
With your intentions of leaving 
And I love these days 
I love them for their edgy ways 
I love them for their sleepless nights 
Never fright 
take a bite 
lose the light 
on life 
could never break my heart again 
roses and wine
