They want to invade into my lounge
Into my lungs, in every way and every day
They're in my walls and they tap to my calls 
It's pulling me under
They want to get pay of things that i've done
A piece of my haul , the system is fake more damage then sake
They want me to change the way that i am 
To be one of them
And how the hell are they going to find me
If I stay in the place that I am
And how the hell are they going to find me
If I don't say nothing to no one
I'm switching the drapes securing the locks
I think I should stop humming the strains
That mess up my brain
I peep through a crack the winter is back
Lightnings and thunders
The more i'm awake the more I am trapped
An intricate maze I feel a bit whacked
From this long phase i think I should stop
Falling to this state that's pulling me under
And how the hell...
