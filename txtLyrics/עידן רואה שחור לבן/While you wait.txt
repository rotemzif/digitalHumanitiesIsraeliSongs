While you wait for something to happen 
While you wait for change to come 
While you change you go uncertain 
You certainly forget your tongue 
While you think your body ages 
When you age your thought is weakened 
All the week I bring you freedom 
You never bring me anything 
While you shout you cannot listen 
When you listen, patiently await your turn 
While you grow your life is changing 
You understand your thoughts were wrong
