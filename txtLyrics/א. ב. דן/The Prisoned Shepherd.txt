Rome! What a scroll of History thine has been!
In the first days thy sword republican
Ruled the whole world for many an ageâ€™s span:
Then of thy peoples thou wert crowned Queen,
Till in thy streets the bearded Goth was seen;
And now upon thy walls the breezes fan
(Ah, city crowned by God, discrowned by man!)
The hated flag of red and white and green.
The prisoned shepherd of the Church of God.
When was thy glory! when in search for power
Thine eagles flew to greet the double sun,
And all the nations trembled at thy rod?
Nay, but thy glory tarried for this hour,
The prisoned shepherd of the Church of God.
When pilgrims kneel before the Holy One,
