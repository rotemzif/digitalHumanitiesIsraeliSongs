I lie in the sun waiting for a better day
I lie in the sun dreaming of another way
So give me the answer if you know what should I do
I lie in the sun waiting for a better day
I sit with my friends watching how they always fight  
I sit with my friends almost every day and night
So give me the answer if you know what should I do
I sit with my friends waiting for a better day
I lie in the sun waiting for a better day
I lie in the sun dreaming of another way
So give me the answer if you know what should I do
I lie in the sun waiting for a better day
