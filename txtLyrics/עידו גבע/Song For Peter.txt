I’ve made a promise to a special old man
On exactly 6:20 pm
I said “from now on I'd be a better man”
And he told me what he's been thru
Where he slept
What he had to do to get a piece of bread
Looking back he drops a tear,
That rough war he calls a sin
And it's green, green all around
On this land I remember it all
And it's green, green all around
From now on I'm a better man
He said: “be good to your mother
Help your father
Do what I could not do, be true
Be proud of who you are
Make a stand
Tell everyone you know what I can't forget”
