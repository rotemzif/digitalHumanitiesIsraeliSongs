Children not supposed to die young 
But what would you do, if they will come to kill you
Out of the window in Benjamin house men point guns and three naked on the floor
One say kill, the other nothing and I am in prison, thinking of myself.
It’s not that I am green, it’s just that I am a little bit anxious 
of insatiable pockets, until will be no more air to breathe
When you breathe
Do you?  Do you?
Do you believe your belief is something real? 
Do you?
I can see the reason of choosing not bringing
New generation to this mess
But it’s you good people I trust to choose and change
Do you?  Do you?
Do you believe your belief is something real? 
Do you?
