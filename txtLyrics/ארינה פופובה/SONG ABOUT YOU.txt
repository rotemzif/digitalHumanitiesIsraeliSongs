there are songs about everything
only there's no song about you
this one goes like the trees grow
like the rivers flow like the waves glow
i love you so
i love you so
there are times my heart wants to break
keeping promises i did not make
you keep my heart beating you keep my dreams
so secret like treasures of ancient kings
i love you so
i love you so
i love you so
i love you so
tam-tam-ta-da-da-da-da-da-dam...

there's a song about you now
your favorite band has come to town
all tickets sold everyone wants to go
the song about you in the best show
i love you so
i love you so
the band plays the song and you will hear
the ways of the world bring us near
as the trees grow the rivers flow
broken hearts let go
i love you so
i love you so
i love you so
i love you so
tam-tam-ta-da-da-da-da-da-dam...
Part C:
you may wonder why this is about you
but you know you know this is about you
you know my love is true (you know)
at once when i find you (you know)
maybe this planet is good for us both
maybe you know what nobody knows
diamond sparkles late night
love shines bright
tam-tam-ta-da-da-da-da-da-dam...
i love you so
i love you so
i love you so
i love you so
