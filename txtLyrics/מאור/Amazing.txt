Even the hardest days I still believe the rain will come
And wash away this pain from me
Cause I still believe in love.
And I don’t know why you left
After all those years that we’ve shared
Cause I don’t wanna feel this Pain, I don’t wanna feel this pain no more.
You choose to run and hide from me
But deep in my heart I know that you’ll always be,
Yes you’ll always be
Cause you are Amazing
Yes you are, Yes you are, Yes you are Amazing to me.
The Year goes by and you’re still on my mind
A thousand miles won’t change my love for you
Cause I still believe you’ll come back
Now friends keeps telling me to try
To be a stronger man, But how can I forget this love.
I wish I never met you at all.
So you choose to run and hide from me
But deep in my heart I know that you’ll always be
Yes you’ll always be.
Cause you are Amazing
Yes you are, Amazing to me.
Cause nobody told you that lately, No body tried to feel your pain
Cause you are, Cause you are
Yes you are, Amazing to me
