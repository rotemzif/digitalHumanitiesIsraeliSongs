Come on
Can you feel it?
Check it out
I was blind
I was feeling Lonely
My hands fell on the ground
I was weak
I was waiting for someone to save me
But now I understand
Now I realize
That we’re all made out of love
We gotta read the signs
We gotta believe in ourselves
Just enjoy the ride for now
It’s a victory
No More Rain
No More Rain
No More Rain
Yee, yea check Check
When I look up at the sky I see no more rain
I can even let go of this pain
I dream, I seek, I find
My life is one of a kind
I live, I laugh, I play
I can live like every day
The sun, The moon, The stars
There’s hope behind my scars
There’s rest beneath my feet
My heart may skip a bit
The peace I know is real
There’s more to what I feel
I know that I can fly
Like eagles in the sky
I soar to higher heights
The future looks so bright
My past has fade away
Forecast no rain today
No More Rain
No More Rain
No More Rain
