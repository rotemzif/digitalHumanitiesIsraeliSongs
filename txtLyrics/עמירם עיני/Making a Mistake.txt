When the Devils in your head
Outnumber the angels on your shoulder
When with every step you take
You can feel you're getting colder
/:And I I I I I I I I I am making a mistake:/
Can you lend me a quarter man cause I'm stuck in this laundry machine, and its spinning so hard, its spinning so mean, and I try and I try and I try and I try and I try to leave.
Just open the door and leave
Cause I I I I I I I I am making a mistake.
Making a mistake
