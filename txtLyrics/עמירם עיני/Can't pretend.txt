Get up get bored, go out get whored, find out what’s in store, if you don’t mind.
Look sharp look cool, remember "nobody's fool", that’s the rule, if you don’t mind.
If you don’t mind being out of time out of place not recognize your face in the mirror, goes to show you who was right
If you don’t mind shoving their face in the dirt for a pretty skirt laid out on your bed at night,
It goes to show you who was right.
Chorus: 
And I can’t pretend to know. And I don’t mean to be mean. 
But I really don’t know what it would take, what it would take, what it would take,
To come clean
If this sounds angry its 'cause I’m tired of apologies, broken hearts and skinned knees, if you don’t mind.
Looking for some understanding, and the tenderness that’s demanding, if you don’t mind.
If you don’t mind being out in the line of fire, in the rampage of desire, out of control.
Beware of your soul.
Chorus
