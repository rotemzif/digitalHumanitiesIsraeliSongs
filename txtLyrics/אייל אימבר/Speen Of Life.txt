people prance like puppets and the pulpits fill with blood 
stepping in their frenzy on the bodies in the mud 
the marrow in their bones has long since turned to ice 
now the earth is getting warm and it drips out through their eyes 
every fifteen minutes someone calls me up at home 
leaving urgent messages to please pick up the phone 
and all these words i write 
they seem to turn to stone 
rolling off the paper landing on my toes 
my right eye and my left eye 
they tell me different tales 
and i didnt feed the cat today and didnt check the mail 
im sitting in my room and i cant believe my eyes 
rolling to oblivion at the speed of lies
