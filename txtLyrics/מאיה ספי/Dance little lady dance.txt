Someone taught me how to dance last night
What a mover, he was
And some one taught me how to do it right
What a groover, he was
He taught me all the steps he knew to rock-n-roll
I found my sense of rhythm but lost my self control.
Dance little lady dance, dance little lady dance
You know you only get one chance
So come on, dance, dance, dance, dance
Someone taught me how  move last night
What a looker, he was
Someone taught me how do it right
What a hoocker, he was
Now we boogie and we bump until we're fit to drop
And when he gets me going, I don't to stop.
Dance little lady dance, dance little lady dance
You know you only get one chance
So come on, dance, dance, dance, dance
Now we boogie and we bump until we're fit to drop
And when he gets me going, I don't to stop
Dance little lady dance, dance little lady dance
You know you only get one chance
So come on, dance, dance, dance, dance
That's what he told me
Oh' what a mover
That's what he told ne
Oh' what a grooverâ€¦
