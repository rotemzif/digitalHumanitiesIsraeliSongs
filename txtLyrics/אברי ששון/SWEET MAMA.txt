Everyday of my life, everyday of my life she is still in my mind every day of my life
Oh sweet mama!
oh sweet mama!
I used to burn up inside, up inside a flock of devils on my side, burn up inside 
Oh sweet mama!
oh sweet mama!
I walk away, walk away, i just walk away since that day she passed away, i just walk away
Oh sweet mama!
oh sweet mama!
 Oh ya mama!
