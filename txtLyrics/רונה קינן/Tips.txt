In a crowded room
When the lights are deemed
And the smoke is thick
Your eyes are feeling tired
And your ears can't stand the noise
Someone creeps behind you and
Kisses the back of your neck and
You're sweating like a pig
But you manage to smile anyway somehow
And then I see you from the other side of the street
And I push my way inside to tell you something insignificant
About the worries of my day
And you scream into my ear
"oh, how nice to see you here"
In a crowded room
When the lights are deemed
I can still see
The tips of your fingers
And I shoot your name 'cross the room
Just to hear the weightless echo of my voice
The girl with the big smile
Is smiling a big big smile in your direction
I'd like to shoot her in the head
And then your glass is getting empty
But you feel too tired to call the waitress
So you say "would you get me another one please?"
You say "well we might as well push this night
To its end"
In a crowded room
When the lights are deemed
I can still see
The tips of your fingers
And I shoot your name 'cross the room
Just to hear the weightless echo of my voice
I wish I could say we were two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl
But unfortunately we were never introduced
And when we meet I scream into your ear
Everything but the one thing that I really want to scream into your ear
In a crowded room
When the lights are deemed
I can still see
The tips of your fingers
And I shoot your name 'cross the room
Just to hear the weightless echo of my voice
Of my voice
My voice
In a crowded room
When the lights are deemed
And the smoke is thick
It's four o'clock in the morning
Time to rest your aching head
We take a cab outside
You drop me off for I need to be drunker than you said
Call me next week is that a tear I see on your cheek
Why do you always have to cry?
'cause in a crowded room
When the lights are deemed
I can still see
The tips of your fingers
And I want to tell you that I've loved you long enough and that's enough for me
It's enough enough enough enough enough enough enough enough enough 
For me
ahhhhhhhhh ahhhhhh ahhhhh
