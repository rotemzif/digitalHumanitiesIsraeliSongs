You will but you won't 
You try but you can't 
There's a black tiger standing at your gate 
The words in your mouth 
They crash to the floor 
You'd look for the key 
If you could open the door 
Nothing I could say will ever 
take away the ice-cold pain 
of the words I didn't say 
I will but I won't 
I try but I can't 
There's a black tiger standing at my gate 
Winter is coming 
To wash up this town 
Are you gonna stick around 
And watch with me 
And walk in the puddles 
And think about May 
We'll ride that black tiger 
Till we are no longer 
Its prey 
Valentine came quick this year 
Remember the last time 
I whispered in your ear 
I will but I won't 
I try but I can't 
There's this black tiger 
Standing at my gate
