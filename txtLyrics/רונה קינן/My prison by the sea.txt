This was never meant to happen
like this
Not that I had some sort of plan
But I swear it wasn't meant to happen like this
Save me from the hurricane this door can't take the wind
Not that I have some sort of plan
But please save me from this hurricane if you can
Days go by and I forget what you look like
Let me out of this prison by the  sea
Weeks go by and your voice is so distant
But you're the only one who has the key
To my prison by the sea
Every time I turn away I seem to miss a train
Everyone knows I'm not to blame
But every time I turn I miss a train
Teach me how to live without you but never leave my sight
Everyone knows this isn't right
God help me survive this night
Days go by and I forget what you look like
Let me out of this prison by the sea
Weeks go by and your voice is so distant
But you're the only one who has the key
To my prison by the sea
