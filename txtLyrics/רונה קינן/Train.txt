I think I met you on a train
A long long time ago
Or should I say
I should have met you on a train
A long long time ago
I would have watched you
Looking out the window
Leaning your hand on the windowpane
All I would have said to you is
I love you
A hundred thousand times
Don't close the door
Don't close the door
But since i didn't met you there
And since i met you here
I wanted to explain to you
They disappear
If you don't keep them warm
Eventually they freeze
All i would have said to you is
I love you
A hundred thousand times
Don't close the door
Don't close the door
You eat and drink the city
But you want to breath the village
Your milk is getting sour
And your eyes are weary
Can you take me with you?
Can I join the ride?
Let's take a train 
Let's take a train
I love you
A hundred thousand times
Don't close the door
Don't close the door
