Wait
For me
Wait for me
Pick
Up the phone
Its me
Wait
Wait for me
Pick up the phone its me
Yes I see her every day
No I dont know what she looks like
Dont come looking for love she said
At 4am when theres someone else
In my bed
Dont come looking for love
She said
Youre just making it hard
Youre just making it hard for me
To leave you quietly
Pick up the phone its me
Yes I see her every day
No I dont know what she looks like
Wait for me
Wait for me
Wait
Wait for me
Wait for me
Wait
Im just making it hard
Im just making it hard for you to leave me
Quietly
Pick up the phone its me
Yes I see her every day
No I dont know what she looks like
All I want is to breath
Wont you breath with me
Find a little space
So we move in-between
And keep one step ahead of yourself
And the heat goes on
And the heat goes on
And the heat goes on
Where the hand has been
