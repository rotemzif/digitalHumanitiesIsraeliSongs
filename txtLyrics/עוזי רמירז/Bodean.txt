Hey Bodean, let me in
I wanna kiss your toe
Hey Bodean, don't be so mean
It's cold out here in the snow
Chorus:
Hey Bodean, don't be so mean
It's cold here and I have nowhere to go
Oh no
Life without you is low and blue
I can't carry on by myself
But still, I do, in hope that you
Won't go out with nobody else
Chorus
Bodean, I can't understand how a pretty girl like you can have such a cold heart
By golly, it's colder than the snowflakes falling on my face
Bo, I love you more than my own mama
And we shall never part
Chorus
Bodean, Bodean, my beauty queen
The fairest damsel of all
My love for you uplifts me heart
The snow, it continues to fall
chorus
