And when the nighttime falls
I can hear you in my walls
Your burned out lonely calls
Please let me see you smile again
I'm standing in the rain
Waiting for the gospel train 
I know I wait in vain
I'm running through the barley straw
My hideout from the law
Girl, I miss you to my bones
I'm feeling most alone
A sprinkle of your fairy dust
Awakening my lust
Breathe it in as if I must
It's trickling through my crust
It was written in the stars 
In centuries afar
Like a fly trapped in a jar
My pocket full of scars
An expedition for the truth
The blossom of your youth
Since I sowed the seeds of sin
I'm burning from within
