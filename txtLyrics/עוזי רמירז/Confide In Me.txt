When the night time moves too slow
N your rooster, he don't crow
You feel hell burnin' from below
Confide in me
When your spaceship doesn't float 
There's a big hole in your boat
Feel the noose tight around your throat
I don't want to let you go
In the end you'll never know, no no no
And your tears they fall like rain
N it's clogging up the drain
N it's dryin' up your brain
Confide in me
A black raven's at your door
Faintly whispering nevermore
I've seen this movie before
Confide in me
I don't want to let you go
In the end you'll never know, no no no
When the night time moves too slow
N your rooster, he don't crow
You feel hell burnin' from below
Confide in me
