She's so young young young
N I'm so old old old
Getting tired tired tired
Think I'll fold fold fold
When I lay lay lay
Down on my face face face 
She's windin up the lace around her brace
She's so high high high
N I'm so low low low
Gonna cry cry cry
Let it go go go
Feel the pain pain pain
Down to my soul soul soul
Hear the cardboard trombones playin rock n roll
She's so pink pink pink
N I'm so gray gray gray
I don't think think think
That I should stay stay stay
Like the wind wind wind 
She blew my brain brain brain
Gonna pack my bag n take the next train
She's so young young young
N I'm so old old old
Getting tired tired tired
Think I'll fold fold fold
Like the wind wind wind 
She blew my brain brain brain
Gonna pack my bag n take the next train
