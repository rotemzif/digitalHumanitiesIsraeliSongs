Its not let to be here
Its not let to feel calm
Its not let to feel free
I always let you feel at home
If its gonne, don’t you worry
Always be whit me ,my love
If its wrong ,don’t you relly want 
To shere whit me,my love
One day
Its not let to feel strong

Im not fool to belive
If its gonne, don’t you worry
Always be whit me ,my love
If its wrong ,don’t you relly want 
To shere whit me,my love
One day
Nothing gonne ever change
Always still the same
Pepol are loving you 
In your way
Here we are not shore anafe
And the time still goes on
You think you can change the world
I bet you will change the world,one day
