I don't say I love you no more, 
You'll always be my man. 
I only say that sometimes it's scary 
Being with you alone. 
That's why I'm leaving you now, 
I'm never coming back. 
It's the only way, 
so please don't be angry 
Be well, that's all I can say 
Be well, that's all I can say 
I don't say I love you no more...
