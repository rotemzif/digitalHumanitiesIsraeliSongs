Deep in the jungle of your head 
Deep in the ice box of your soul 
An ever changing voice begin to wail 
Bear-hug is in control 
They fused your mind 
They changed your name 
Bear-hug loving is their game 
They fused your mind 
They sopped your heart 
Bear-hug loving is their art 
Bear-hug, you can't avoid it 
Bear-hug, you can't destroy it 
Bear-hug, come for your honey 
Bear-hug, don't think it's funny 
Bear-hug
