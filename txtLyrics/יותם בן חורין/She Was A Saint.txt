Everything just comes and goes she said to me.
“I’m the best you’d ever have” but I’m simply not amused.
She sees herself in a wedding dress,
The only thing I see is a deathbed.
I’ll never feel like you.
She was a saint I could not find.
What should we do if were lonely inside?
She was a saint I could not find.
What should we do with our bind?
Is there anyone out there?
A bad addiction is a bad infliction.
I’ve bottled up a romance for a while.
It keeps changing like my moods.
Out of bounds where you’re safe and sound.
I should’ve let it rest a long time ago.
I’m just sick of being a tool.
How could she love if she can’t love herself?
In her eyes I’m always someone else.
Maybe I’m just too hard on myself.
