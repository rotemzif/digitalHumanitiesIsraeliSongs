Your love is like the ocean but there’s no one around.
It’s empty of emotion, deep as the sea of sound.
Every time a dreamer, an angel in disguise
You swallow up the fever and never decide.
If love is the way you’re loving the feeling that I want to be
wherever you are.
If something will change; give me a reason because it’s tearing
us both apart.
I’ve seen the world through your eyes, what a sad experience.
You were to me always, prohibited area.
Do you remember what a spark we used to have?
Ever since, I lost touch with myself, I can’t feel a thing.
Does it mean anything to you?
Does it mean anything to you?
Does it mean anything to you?
It doesn’t mean anything.
