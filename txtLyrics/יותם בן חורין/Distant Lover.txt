I want to be distant lover.
Call you when you’re down.
Disconnect myself from me.
I want to be distant lover,
Right before we drown.
Cut my rope and set me free.
But, it’s you I’m calling mystified.
Are you faking suicide?
What’s the use of hurting yourself now?
But, it’s you taking me back and forth.
I’m down like a wounded horse.
What’s the use of hurting yourself now?
I want to be distant lover.
Swimming in my cell.
Patience never worked for me.
I’ll never be just another.
Would you reconcile and
Tell me if I’m in too deep?
I used to love her.
