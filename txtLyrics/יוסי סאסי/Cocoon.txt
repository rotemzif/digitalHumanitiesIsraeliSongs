You've come this far just to be a shell,
It's only a coil, the place where you dwell,
Why won't you wake up, see and smell?
Outside there's beauty, warm rays of light,
I know you're scarred, and maybe you're right,
Can you imagine that first flight?
You're breaking that heart, yes its true,
You're fighting the things that I knew,
You're letting your dream slip through.
This golden cage of yours, comfy enough,
Inside you're soft yet they think you're rough,
Don't let them think that you're not tough.
Even the sands can't hide,
You're almost there, one stride,
after you've tried & tried.. open wide...
You're breaking, youâ€™re out, yes its true,
You're fighting the things I once knew,
You're letting your dream to shine through
