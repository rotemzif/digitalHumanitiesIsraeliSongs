I cannot reach you 
I cannot reach 
And I miss our talks 
Your eyes 
I miss our laughs 
Your smile 
The way your joy was feeding mine 
Time cannot teach you 
Time cannot teach 
And I miss our walks 
Your touch 
I dream your smell 
Your hugs 
The way your lust grew into mine 
And you were always there 
You were always there 
I cannot save you 
I cannot save 
And I miss our fights 
Your spite 
Your fears and lies 
Tonight 
The way your pain 
Was leaving mine 
Still you are always there 
You are always there
