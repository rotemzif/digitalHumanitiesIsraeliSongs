Don't make me say it explicitly 
Don't make me define 
Don't make me put it into words 
I cannot seem to find 
Look into my eyes 
the first thing comes to mind 
Won't be a lie 
Some Originality a touch of honesty 
Won't do you harm 
You seem so nice 
I would love to have one minute with you 
Don't ask me questions predictably 
Please don't be so dry 
Don't stare at me unmanly 
It don't make you look too fly 
Some Originality a touch of honesty 
Won't do you harm 
There's no need to be so deep 
It's only just one flirt 
And then goodbye
