How sweet how new 
waking up to you 
You're foolish and rude 
it's paradise with you 
So sweet and true 
waking up with you 
I'll never be blue now that I found you 
darling I found you 
What can I do but lay down here with you 
I'm laying down with you 
I'm so in love with you it's so true 
I will never be blue
