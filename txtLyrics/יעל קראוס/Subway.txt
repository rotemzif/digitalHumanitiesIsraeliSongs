Inside the ground imagining the roots 
Tangled in the trains 
The only way to bear the subway 
I close my eyes pretend to smell a scent of roses 
Close my eyes as the sound of trains becomes the ocean 
I'm so far away far away 
Inside the ground examining the rats 
Sneak about the tracks 
The only way to bear the subway 
I close my eyes pretend to smell a scent of roses 
Close my eyes as the sound of trains becomes the ocean 
I'm so far away far away
