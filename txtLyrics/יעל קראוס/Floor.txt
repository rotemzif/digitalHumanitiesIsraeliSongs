Aren't you just afraid of losing me? 
Aren't you just afraid of letting me go? 
Aren't you just afraid of bruising me? 
There are ways to treat a fragile girl 
If you let me walk out the door 
Why, why, why every time we try 
I end up on the floor?
 Aren't you tired of abusing me
Don’t we need to fight and make out all night long? 
Aren't you strong enough for holding me? 
Don’t you love all those dramatic girls?
If you let me walk out the door 
Why, why, why every time we try 
I end up on the floor?
