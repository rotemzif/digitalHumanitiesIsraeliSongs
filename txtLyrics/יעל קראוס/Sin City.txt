Night falls darkness comes 
Demons out on the town 
Bloods bubbling 
Restless again 
Sin city is where I'm at 
Sin city is my home 
Tangled maze I'm lost in lust 
Marked my face a smile of rust 
Giant walls are closing down 
Empty space's spreading wild 
Smashed concrete broken lane 
Circus city is where I play 
Circus city is my stage 
White dress turning black 
High boots, loaded tank 
Don't overdo it 
You might burn yourself before you start 
Don't overdo it 
It's the best nightmare you've had so far 
Puppies turning into wolves 
Pinky tang to decisive tooth 
Someone's handing me illusion's cup 
Blurry city is spinning round 
I am clinging to the ground 
Animated lights I see 
Sidewalks melting into the sea 
Don't overdo it...
