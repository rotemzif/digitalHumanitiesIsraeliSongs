Delicious indeed you are to me 
Once in a while I allow myself 
The pleasure of you 
Good for the skin, I will have you from within 
As I become a thief 
Delicious indeed you are to me 
You taste so good 
Though I know I should 
Not get used to the fancy style of you 
To the fancy style 
Addicted indeed your flesh to me 
Too many times I was drown to my baby delight 
The price is high 
I will pay it and then cry 
Forbidden and so far
