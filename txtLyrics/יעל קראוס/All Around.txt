I have no place else to go tonight 
Would you take me? 
I have lost the keys to my house 
Would you take me? 
I will fill your room with caressing lights 
If you'll take me 
I will make hot tea with sunrise 
If you'll take me 
All around it goes 
A ball is round and you should know 
What comes goes 
All around is gold 
The world is bound for you to know 
What comes goes 
Clouds are closing down on the streets tonight 
Would you have me? 
Selfish rain is pouring on this town 
Would you have me? 
I will put clean sheets on your bed tonight 
If you'll have me 
I will sit and wait for you each night 
If you'll have me 
All around it goes... 
Don't let me fall
