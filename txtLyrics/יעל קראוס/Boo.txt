I'm so busy being myself
So busy being myself
Living my life
Chasing the dream
Fearing my fears
letting no one in
Building my hopes
Crashing them down
Too busy chasing myself around
Boo oo how I used to boo you
Now you boo me too
We make boo oo boo oo
You're so busy being yourself
So busy being yourself
Stating your mind
fighting your fights
Defending your rights
Not knowing what's right
Selling your truth
playing the game
Wearing a face
Pretending you're sane
Boo oo how I use to boo you
Now you boo me too
We make boo oo boo oo
We're so busy being ourselves
So busy ourselves
Drifting apartâ€¦
