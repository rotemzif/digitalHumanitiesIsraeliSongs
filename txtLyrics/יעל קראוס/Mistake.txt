He loves me 
How can I tell him the truth 
He trusts me 
How can i break him the news 
Devotion, don't make me look into your eyes 
Don't make me look 
He knows me 
My silence will shout out the guilt 
He hugs me 
It's aching how perfect we fit 
Forgiveness, open your door, let me in 
Compassion, Open your door 
Lost myself and made a mistake 
If you'll stay I promise to learn 
He loves me 
How can I tell him the truth 
He trusts me 
How can i break him the news 
Forgiveness, open your door, let me in 
Compassion, open your door 
Lost myself and made a mistake 
If you'll stay I promise to learn 
He loves me 
He loves me 
He loves me
