Verse 1:
With first light I walk
A reality made of sound
I`ve been up all night
Sleeping but up
I think i`m still asleep
I can`t tell anymore
So now i`m following the light
I`m ahead but behind
Can you teach me to remember nothing
But know who I am
The wheres, the why whys, the whats
They`re too heavy for my shoulders
Chorus:
The sky is too deep
The sea is too high
The future becomes afraid of the past
Verse 2:
With one life I try
To find some kind of meaning
Something coherent
While I keep getting drunk
Can you teach me to think of something
That`s never been thought of
The rights, the wrongs, the maybes
I`ll ban them from existence
Chorus 
With first light I walk
And i`m not getting anywhere
With one life I try
And the victims are everywhere
Chorus 
Afraid of the past
