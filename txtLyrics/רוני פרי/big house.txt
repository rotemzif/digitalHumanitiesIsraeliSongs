Learn for grades, do for money
Think as you`re told
Or you can`t join in
No you`re not invited
And you won`t deserve being at all
Buy a big house
Put a bigger fence around it
See the world through thick glass
And you`ll call it freedom
But there will be no real breathing
Take things in, throw things out
Breath to live
But there`s no heart inside
Get things done get paid
Go outside get laid 
Come back inside, cry
I`d rather die
(instrumental)
When I leave I won`t come back
If I leave, I found a good place to hide
