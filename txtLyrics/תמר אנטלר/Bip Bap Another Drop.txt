Another Day has passed
Just got out of bed
4 in the afternoon
I'm such a badass
But all I wish for is
A comfortable life
Without a need to think
Or react, oh no
Just put on my best smile
It's so easy to shut up
So shut up, shut up!
Every night I'm spending my time
In a different bar
It’s great to assume
That I am somebody
"Someday I'll be a star,
Did you know that?"
-"Oh, that's nice honey
By the way it coasts 55…55…55…55"
Bip bip bip bip bip bip bap
Drinking another drop
I can’t make it stop
The music in my head
Bip bip bip bip bip bip bap
Give me another shot and
Pass me around from one to another
The cigarette smells
Like something I can rely on
Why don't you take my picture
I look so damn hot with this cigarette
Well, it's your loss
That you don't take my picture
Don't you want
To sit down and get to know me
I'm so interesting
With those lovely cloths I wear
My hairstyle is perfect
Those shoes are a
Unique piece by
Mm, well, you know who
Bip bip bip bip bip bip bap
Drinking another drop
I can’t make it stop
The music in my head
Bip bip bip bip bip bip bap
Give me another shot and
Pass me around from one to another
