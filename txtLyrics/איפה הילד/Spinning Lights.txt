Hollywood where the giant stars have been frozen 
Filthy streets where junkies wait for the fix 
Pour my heart out to a second hand Madonna 
But she's sad and drunk it's so hard to get excited 
And the spinning lights explodes in my face 
And I'll never be a pavement star no way 
In a lovers change there's hours of anticipation 
She is miles away in the memories of my home 
Hollywood where the losers all had gathered 
I'm so down and out it's so hard to get ahead 
And the spinning lights...
