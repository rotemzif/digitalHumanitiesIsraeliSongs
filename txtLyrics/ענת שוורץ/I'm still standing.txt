You could never know what its like 
Your blood like winter freezes just like ice 
And theres a cold lonely light that shines from you 
Youll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use 
And did you think this fool could never win 
Well look at me, Im coming back again 
I got a taste of love in a simple way 
And if you need to know while Im still standing you just fade away 
Im still standing better than I ever did 
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid 
Im still standing after all this time 
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind 
Im still standing yeah yeah yeah 
Im still standing yeah yeah yeah 
Once I never could hope to win 
You starting down the road leaving me again 
The threats you made were meant to cut me down 
And if our love was just a circus youd be a clown by now 
Bat Dont you know Im still standing better than I ever did 
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid 
Im still standing after all this time 
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind 
Im still standing yeah yeah yeah
