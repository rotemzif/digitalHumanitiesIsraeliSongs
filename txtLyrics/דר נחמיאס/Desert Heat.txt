Days are longer, nowhere, desert heat. 
Short with water, short with air to breath, 
I see boat by tears, but it isn't real. 
All my vision kills, all those fancy will 
Days are longer, but I don't have much time to loose 
Hope that someday, we will find which way to choose 
Somewhere snowing, somewhere desert heat 
Far to notice, which star is yours to seek 
Days are longer, nowhere, desert heat...
