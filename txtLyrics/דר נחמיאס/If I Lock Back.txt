If I look back 
And you're not there. 
I start to think, 
You got you're own way to say, 
You won't understand. 
Listen to your heart and tell me what you find, to blame 
And you don't know 
What ever happened, 
To my senseless loving world. 
Confusion didn't change my way. 
To fall into your hole, 
So deep and slow. 
Fall in through your soul, 
And make you feel strong, 
To change your world 
If I look back...
