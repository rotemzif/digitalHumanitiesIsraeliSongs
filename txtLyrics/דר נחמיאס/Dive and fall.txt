I see you, but you can't see me Anymore. 
Cold as ice, in darkest nights, 
I dive and fall. 
Ground I am seeking, So far I am drifting, 
With no control. 
I see the stars from both, 
Black sea is taking me gently from the shore, 
And I am falling... 
Below the ocean there's a fish 
That lives alone. 
And then when I am floating, 
The wind start shocking, 
My little peace of mind. 
Cold as ice, in darkest night, 
I dive and fall
