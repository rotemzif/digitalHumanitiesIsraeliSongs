I’m not mad 
I’m just sad 
I’m not jealous 
It’s just my stomach 
Its too bad 
Things got hard 
I’m not worried 
Life’s full of presents 
And what name should I call you 
Next time we talk 
It took so long 
To ,, find this one 
And what else could I tell you 
Next time we talk 
Yes my grandma is well 
How’s your father take care 
I’m not responsible 
For your aging anymore 
It’s not my fault 
That time keeps on passing 
I’m no mad 
I’m just sad 
I’m not jealous 
And what name should I call you... 
And what else could I tell you...
