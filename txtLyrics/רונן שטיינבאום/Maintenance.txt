Maintenance that’s what I’m 
Into these days 
The guitar, the car,
My body, my heart
Maintenance keep appointments 
Make new ones
Think fast, talk clear, concentrate
Don’t loose the grip
I sleep enough
I eat enough
Floating floating
Maintenance that’s what I’m 
Into these days 
The ceiling, the stars, my things 
And the ones I don’t have
Maintenance throw the garbage 
Put a new bag
Get in, go out, calculate smile
Don’t get caught
I sleep enough 
I eat enough
Floating floating
