I will fly like a butterfly 
And I will sting like a bee 
I will shoot golden arrows 
In all directions 
I will still a horse and ride it 
For as long as I can 
I will sing hymns and prayers 
At the top of my lungs 
I will float down the river 
I will never look back 
I will turn all the road signs 
And make them point up 
I see my shadow 
Seems he's smiling at me 
Telling me you're going nowhere 
You've got no direction 
I reply you're just a color 
You don't even exist 
And I can paint you in orange 
Make you look like a clown 
Then I will float down the river 
I will never look back 
I will turn all the road signs 
And make them point up
