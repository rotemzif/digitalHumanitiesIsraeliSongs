Under the sky 
There is only me 
I gulp the silence 
In little sips 
I see a shadow 
I know its mine 
I need some answers 
But I have time 
I count in my heart 
One two three 
With a melody of 
A prayer I heard 
When I was a kid 
One two three 
With a melody of a prayer 
Beneath a cloud 
There is enough light 
To see the way 
That will get me by 
I’ll know when I’m there 
Like I know I'm here 
I’ll find all the things 
That have disappeared 
I’ll count in my heart..
