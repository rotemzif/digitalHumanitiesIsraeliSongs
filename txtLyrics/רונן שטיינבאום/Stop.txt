I spend my days 
Flying around in my room 
I flap my eyelashes fast 
And they serve me as wings 
I spend my days 
Trying to communicate 
I pull out my antennas 
And when I pick up a sign 
I stop what I’m doing 
Lay on my back 
Put up my legs 
And move them in rhythm 
I spend my days 
Looking at patterns and shapes 
I move them a little 
And put them back in their place 
I spend my days 
Making little notes to my self 
I hide them in the house 
So I can find them one day 
And stop what I’m doing… 
Here she comes with all her curves 
And her Mona Lisa smile 
Telling me that from a labyrinth 
You come out by going up 
Stop what I’m doing…
