Winter is coming 
I am not ready yet 
Just learned how to make 
All kinds of soup 
In kindergarden 
I would beat up the other kids 
I don’t know why 
I’m thinking of this 
Save changes save changes 
Save changes save changes 
Police man walking by me 
I look the other way 
As if they knew about something 
I haven’t done (yet) 
Breathing costs money now 
We’re not kids any more 
Save changes…
