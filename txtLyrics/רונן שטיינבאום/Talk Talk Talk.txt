Most of the people
Talk talk talk
Most of the people
Are addicted to themselves
Pretend theyâ€™re listening 
So they can go on
Inventing answers for questions 
That you never had
Most of the people
Block block block
Most of the people
Always seem to be o.k
Go in go out just not to be alone
And wake up tired knowing 
There is something they forget
Just make some waves
Create a buzz
You should be fine
If not come back
Most of the people
Want more more more
Of no matter what no matter why 
No matter where
Most of the people
Talk talk talk
Most of the people
Are addicted
Just make some waves
Create a buzz
You should be fine
If not come back
