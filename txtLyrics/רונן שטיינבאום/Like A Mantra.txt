When I was small 
I listened to the radio 
I would record 
The biggest hits into cassettes 
I used to kick A tennis ball 
back and forth into the wall 
I'd walk around the house 
Reciting "I am bored I am bored" 
Like a mantra 
When I grew up 
I was afraid of girls 
I dated only those 
I didn't like 
Iâ€™d shave my head 
So I can pass my hand 
on top of my scalp 
back and forth 
I'd walk around the house 
Reciting "I am bored I am bored" 
Like a mantra
