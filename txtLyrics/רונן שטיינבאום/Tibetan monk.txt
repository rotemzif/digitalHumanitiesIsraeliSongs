All these books and movies 
Are starting to seem 
sophisticated ways of publicity 
It's not a product they're selling 
It's the way that they think 
I'd like to stop for a second 
And step out of bed Like 
the first step of the moon 
So light and bright 
And yet so brand new 
The first sound I hear 
Will be a hum 
coming out of me 
Like a Tibetan monk 
All these people around 
Who want me to succeed 
Their good advice and intentions 
Are making me freeze 
It's not the words that they're saying 
It's the way that they speak 
I'd like to stop for a second 
And step out of bed Like... 
The first image 
Just a shade of white 
Gradually turning into bright light 
The first sound I hear 
Will be a hum coming out of me 
All these books and movies...
