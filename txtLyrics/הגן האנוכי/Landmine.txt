I made it to the landmine 
It made want to die 
The cowardly perception 
Of returning to the sky 
What if I had it all? 
What if I had the time? 
It made me feel like sugar 
It made me feel like pain 
It melted all the lust and 
Aggravation in the rain 
And if I made it stop 
And if I could stop crying… 
Thought you were never going down 
A towering inferno 
Caresses my beliefs 
It’s devious and ugly 
And its hatred full of grief 
I made it into bronze 
I never had the chance 
Thought you were never going down 
Given some candy corn 
Given a chance to stay 
Today 
I made into heaven 
It made me wanna spit 
A thorough compensation 
For reliving pain with wit 
I know it had it all 
I know I had the time 
Thought you were never going down 
Given some candy corn 
Given a chance to stay 
Today
