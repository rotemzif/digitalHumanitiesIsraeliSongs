I have the body of a hunter, the eyes of a victim
The sickness of someone who was left too many times
I have the hunger of a stranger an old desire for danger
The self pity of someone who loves himself too much
I'm a second generation survivor and a second generation loser
I'm a second generation survivor and a second jeneration loser
And I'll keep changing all the time but I'll always remain the same child
Insane child
I've got pretensious ambitions on the verge of demolition
the power of someone who's wasted too much time
I've got my future behind me, my nightmares to blind me
The weakness of someone who'll never get your love
I'm a second generation...
