It's time to move on 
I'm saying goodbye 
With a tear in my eye 
I'm wishing you the best 
And I know I will see you again, sometime 
I'm setting you free 
Because I love you 
And care for you 
Wherever you go 
Wherever I go 
I will keep you close to my heart 
And pain, you know 
It comes and goes 
The only thing you really have 
Is yourself and then comes all the rest 
You are still the best 
And nothing's gonna change that 
I will think of you at night 
Because I love you 
And care for you 
Love you
