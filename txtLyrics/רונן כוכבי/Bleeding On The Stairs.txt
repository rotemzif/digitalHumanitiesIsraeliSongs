I’ve been thinking to myself Where to go
I was bleeding on the stairs but felt so strong
I’m shining like a sun but got no burns 
I’m gonna be a star I’ve got the faith
There’s nothing I can say
To make it go away
I’ve been here for so long
I hope that I can stay
They are pushing me around I don’t care
When I get that crown they will pay
There’s nothing I can say
To make it go away
I’ve been here for so long
I hope that I can stay
I’m ready for the show to fill me up 
We’re gonna hit the road Close the gap
