Can I miss you more than this?
Without any means I'm traveling
Far away from you further from myself
I have learned some new things
About you about me about god
Now I know I am on my own
Wish I'd feel a bit better
I have never been around here
Makes me sad to be here on my own
I got a lot of weight on my shoulders
Feels like losing in a race against myself
I am scared and I'm wounded bad
Your pretty face pops up in my head, again
I'm afraid of what there is outside
Looking for a safer place to lie down
City lights and drunken soul
Rip my heart out leaving me on my own
I am cold and I'm just about
To shut myself off
And give up the struggle
