Now that I'm cut in half the same way as before
I try to pass my time alone
Now that I'm cut in half and no one knows my name
I hide behind the sunken sun again
These moments feel so strange that I can't understand
Who's my enemy and who's my friend?
So I just round the suspects one at a time
Until I find some peace of mind
So lately day by day I'm passing with a smile
And I'm not sure the reason why
And words I plan to say they vanish in the air
And I don’t even seem to care
I can't afford to be happy all the time
Loosing control I'll be dead by a smile
Now how will save the day and tell me it’s a lie?
'Couse I've got nothing else in mind
I'm not sure where I am I'm loosing track of time
I'm to afraid to be left behind
I can't afford to be happy all the time
Loosing control I'll be dead by a smile
Time isn’t passing when I'm happy with who I am
Where is the anger I got used to?
