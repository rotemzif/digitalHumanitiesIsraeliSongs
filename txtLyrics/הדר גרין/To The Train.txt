In the shadows lurking every time around
Under siege the hero tries to save his town
Wondering pillow dust a servant to your dreams 
Waiting hours for the train to reach the trees
Try to call your name 
Time and time again
Try to call your name
One more time again
Try to call your name 
Time and time again
In the flesh will come a day
We could stay away
