Noting in broken fixing the past it's not working
Hairs on the mirror hairs every where I'm not sleeping 
Taws it down there is nothing to take if you get out of town
Calculate there is none to be hid from a hat with no head
There's no way there's no way to loose
You're bound to loose 
You're bound to loose
There's no way there's no way not today
All the way nothing in
All the way 
Continuing sessions I'd love to recall I can't remember 
The band on the paper the paper band the perfect reflection                Taws it down there is nothing to take if you get out of town
Calculate there is none to be hid from a hat with no head
All the way nothing in
All the way nothing within
There's a hole in my wall
