Uncomfortable thoughts are making me crazy
Sitting and wondering on treason acts inflicted on me
Every day and night I'm loosing a bit of affection
Live in a world of deceitful lies I'm telling to me
Don’t be afraid it comes and it goes
Don’t go insane and relax before you fall
I'm going crazy again
Holding it tightly until the days over
Making sure to close the door before the crack opens
Mood switch and mood change it's hard to keep track of it any way
I've gone lost in the lost town
And I can't find my way back
Don’t be afraid it comes and it goes
Don’t go insane and relax before you fall
I'm going crazy again
I've gone lost on my way but I'm not a bit afraid
I can write it away I can run rather stay
