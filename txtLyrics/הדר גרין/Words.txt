Left with only feelings I can never find the words
Try to give it meaning still it fades just like before
I'm stuck now at the corner hiding by the trees
One more time I'm grasping for an explanation 
Under influences I am feeling kind of strong
Now I'm sitting smiling staring at the sealing 
Close your eyes and concentrate you'll find a way
Take a peaceful moment thinking of your day
Now that I am happy I am vulnerable as hell 
The sun out side is rising and I think I'm feeling well 
Dealing with my demons writing me a song
Some times I get tired only hearing my own voice
I go and take a shower with out leaving other choice 
Now I'm thinking of her now I think of me
