No hesitations 
I'm not sure what im doing there is no other voice in me
Feeling sick and I wonder could it be that I'm on my feet
There are no angels and devils I've got freedom to act my way
But im now in a problem because I've been searching to long that I cant tell what's wrong with me
Im waiting for love to save the day
It will be the judge if im ok
Im missing a part I'm going stray
Its not the and
There's a road to be taking and I thought that I know the way
Feeling crazy and honest doesn't help in a dieing day
Taking steps when im sober
What will happen when im asleep
See im now in a problem cause I've been waiting to long that I think that im in to deep
Im waiting for love to save the day
It will be the judge if im ok
Im missing a part I'm going stray
Its not the and
If I feel to close I'll need away
Don’t get hurt by every word I say
If there's something in I'd probably know
You don’t have to shout it out my door
