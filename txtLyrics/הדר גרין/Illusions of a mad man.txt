Feeling low again buried in the sand
It all just feels the same I'm getting used to shame
There is nothing I could say to make this go away
If common sense is a friend I donâ€™t know how I am
I'm drinking blood I'm throwing rocks
I'm burning fan mail in the dark 
I'm running to I'm hiding from 
But leaving foot steps for the sun
I'm sending signs that can't be missed
And waiting for apocalypse 
It's not the end but it could be 
It's taking so much out of me
Choose your picture for the day
Come tomorrow it will change
Count the minutes on your smile 
It won't last more than a while wrap your self in providence 
It won't matter if you are sane
Start believing in your eyes
You may find the truth in lies
