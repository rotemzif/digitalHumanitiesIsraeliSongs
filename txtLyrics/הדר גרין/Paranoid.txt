I never seem to be on track hanging by a sadness line
It's up to me to understand the ways that I can act some times
I didn’t know you were afraid but I won't act a different way
I think I'm running out of air I could never stand another hit
All the magic I feel is gone 
Never seemed to be good for you
With these feelings I might be wrong
I'm still paranoid
You're still a cloud of smoke to me that never clears or goes away
I'm still a slave to what I feel the fog is now a cloud of pain
I don’t know how to rid of guilt its burning every part of me
I try to run but I stand still I just wanna capture what I feel
All the magic I feel is gone 
Never seemed to be good for you
With these feelings I might be wrong
I'm still paranoid
I guess I thought you were away to revile the secret code 
Set example for the world
I guess I thought I'd be insane if I'd never see you smile
If I wasn’t worth your wile
I guess I haven't much to say but to scream out of my boredom
And to never be back here again                  
All the magic I feel is gone 
Never seemed to be good for you
With these feelings I'm never wrong
You make me paranoid
