Disappointed I made a fool of my self I took credit away from feel
I let the passion take a hold of me when I reluctant to notice fear
Now I'm just realizing, more like confessing some how, I see the truth as a rotten mess 
I'm obligated to take control for my self
And never disregard the fact
It only hurts when you push it 
You can lie to your self for days
It only hurts when you push it
'till the truth comes to smash your face
I'm a rock star I stand on stages at night I donâ€™t care if it's wrong or right
At list I'm consistent no I'm not loosing it yet 
You lost your gift I think I still have mine
It's kind of sad I believed you even though you never told a lie
You're just a drag a believer a blinded follower a wasted sigh
Its time for rocknroll I'm gonna take it all
Its time for rocknroll the truth is what I adore
Its time for rocknroll I'm gonna scream a lot
Its time for rocknroll you're to scared of the noise
I'm so pathetic I used to cry for your shit
I put my dignity beneath your feet
The situation is getting critical now when I'm not sure it wouldn't happen again
