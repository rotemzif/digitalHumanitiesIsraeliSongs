Open the window 
from within 
Let the sun come 
lighten up the pain 
For your arms that grab the sorrow 
throw it all into flames 
your eyes cries with sorrow 
let it dry up again 
What if we spend our life in vain 
Why all love games end up in pain 
Like a poison drown from a vein 
Your spirit will rise once again 
I know the pain that hunts you 
it's all the same 
Open the window & let in the rain 
What if we spend our life in vain 
Why all love games end up in pain 
Close Your Eyes 
See The Stars
