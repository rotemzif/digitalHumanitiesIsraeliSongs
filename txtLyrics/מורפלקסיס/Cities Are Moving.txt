I can still hear you breath 
from the silence of my door step 
I go outside 
to see the lights 
A December night 
& everybody's sleeping 
From a distance i hear 
The Cities Are Moving 
I walk Alone 
through broken street lights 
Follow the beat of your heart 
I can still hear you breath 
deep down under 
In the silence of the night.. 
The Cities Are Moving
