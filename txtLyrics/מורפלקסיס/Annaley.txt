I remember they taught me in school 
about the wanderings of men & they're truths 
in late nights i kept my heart inspired 
by the moon & the stars of my desires 
Then there came all those dreams 
of hollow cities with their beings 
& the stories that they bring 
about a girl named Annaley.. 
She had a pale skin 
She had a black hair 
She had a long dress 
She sang with those silver eyes 
She stood by the window every night 
& stared back at the stars 
haven't you heard? 
her moans, her moans! 
If there's a star in the sky 
that's where lay her heart 
& where ever you'll go 
she'll know 
That's the tears that you weep 
are all hers to keep 
Where ever I'll go 
I'll know 
just one name 
Annaley
