Well I'm so sorry to say 
It's all been said before 
So let the music be the key 
To unlock your heart's door 
Monkeys do what monkeys see 
The jezuz fish man did it first 
We all draw from the same spring 
Just to satisfy our thirst 
You're a cosmos to yourself 
With no place left to go 
So you stargaze in the lights 
Of another cheap rock show 
The 1's and 0's in your mind 
Drive you virtually mad 
Adult dreams of childhood fun 
The best times you've ever had 
SIReality, plug us into your matrix, dominate 
SIReality, our brain is tired; won't you think for us again 
And be for us a loyal friend 
Please think for us again, and be for us a friend
