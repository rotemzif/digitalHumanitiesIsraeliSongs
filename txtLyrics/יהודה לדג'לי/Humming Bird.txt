Metallic blue body 
Flurry whisper of wings 
Staccato-like motion 
Please let me hear you sing again 
Instinctively seeking 
The colours of life 
With each flower's meeting 
You thrust in your needleknife 
O 2 B az free az U R 
2 sleep in Peace, faithfully beneath 
The stars... 
You have no possessions 
You share what you need 
With all Nature's creatures 
Who know nothing of greed 
You nest in a building 
Without paying the rent 
Fluttering and singing 
Is how your days are spent 
O 2 B az free az U R 
2 sleep in Peace, faithfully beneath 
The stars... 
No rushing around 
Never feeling down 
About what you should do 
Nothing to say, no need to pray 
Your life's a prayer of gratitude 
No titles or names 
Or devious games 
To prove that you're good 
Only the vitality that Nature's given you 
A gift of life that's modest but true 
Your life's but a fraction 
Of the years I'll prevail 
Yet it seems so much fuller 
There's nothing you can fail at 
You are what you are 
A natural entity 
And I'm so much bigger 
Yet afraid of what I can be 
O 2 B az free az U R 
2 sleep in Peace, faithfully beneath 
The stars...
