Greg Lirette is a king in my own mind 
I don't know how he got there but he got there in time 
And like him I'm givin' this a try 
So we don't have to be all dainty, dancin' on lives 
You know it's true 
You know you've felt it B-4 
-est City Bluez 
Makes the newz in this whirld scream out for more 
The record's broken, turn the page 
Give or take 33, infiniteaze our age 
Never did become Western sages 
Just graduates of South in the Great White North 
Where the rage izzzzz... 
You know it's true 
You know you've felt it B-4 
-est City Bluez 
Makes the newz in this whirld scream out for more 
Takes the bruizin' out of peaceful war 
Let's the losers win it all forever more 
You know we're the purest of all sound 
It doesn't matter what or why or who or how 
Just believe and live our dreamz out loud 
In the city streets with freaks from farming townz 
You know it's true 
You know you've felt it B-4est City Bluez 
Paints the hues in this whirld'z self-portrait 
Fills the pews with lost degenerates 
Makes the newz in this whirld scream out for more 
Takes the bruizin' out of peaceful war 
Let's the losers win it all forever more
