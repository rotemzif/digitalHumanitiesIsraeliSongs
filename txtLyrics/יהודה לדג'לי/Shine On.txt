Layin with the lionz in the town hall square 
At peace with everything since there are no fuckin' people anywhere 
Sketched out a story of morbid prose 
'bout my self-pity but I've switched the roles {I'm king of this jungle man!} 
Fingers shadow-dancin in the moonlight 
Sip on fermented wheat and smoke my last Lucky Strike 
Pure thoughts immersed into a sea of smut 
Like Mr. Waters after the Final Cut {oh god, I wish you were here now...} 
Your dayz are numbered my friend 
What's that you mumbled 'bout never comin' back here again? 
You say the light's gone out; you've nothin' left to burn 
But you'll shine on... 
Smuggled some grass into the cancer ward 
And snuck my friend into the washroom down the corridor 
Enjoyed a few hits in an empty stall 
Until the nurses found us and stole it all {just nursin' our habit girl} 
"there's a price to pay young man for doing this," 
"well that's just fine officer, now let me finish takin' a piss. 
And just so ya know that's my only friend. And she's gonna be dead soon 
So please let us smoke up again." {we hate authority, Sir...} 
Your dayz are numbered my friend 
What's that you mumbled 'bout never comin' back here again? 
You say the light's gone out; you've nothin' left to burn 
But you'll shine on...
