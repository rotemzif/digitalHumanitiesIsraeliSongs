Into the womb of the desert night 
Illumination, starlight 
Escape the worries of city life 
Sharpen the contrast with a Shabbos knife 
Reflect upon all that you have learned 
On times of burning and being burned 
Whispers of wind carry your tears of joy 
"you are a good man and a better boy" 
You know it's alright 
Life will never bite 
But help yourself to a slice of pie 
You can do anything 
Just let your soul sing 
And ring out like a prayer beyond the sky
