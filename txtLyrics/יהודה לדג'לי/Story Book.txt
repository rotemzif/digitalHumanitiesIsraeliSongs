Entertain me little girl in one of your storybooks 
We'll ride a great white horse all day long 
Lay in fields where 4-leaf clover and white poppies grow 
And the moon will shine upon us all night long 
See the phoenix and the dove soaring so high above 
With just one wish we could be like them 
It's true the things we yearn for seem so far away 
We're all just dreamers who can't sleep 
And don't you think sometimes 
It would be oh so nice 
If a shooting star fell from above 
Entertain me little girl in one of your storybooks 
We'll ride a great white horse all day long 
Lay in fields where 4-leaf clover and white poppies grow 
And the moon will shine upon us all night long 
See the boy jump from his balcony for he had no wings 
To take him sailing up to the stars 
Don't let your cloudy mind fade into blackened skies
