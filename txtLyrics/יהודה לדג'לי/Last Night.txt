And I know it's easy to forget me 
And I know it's hard to understand 
And I hope you like what you find 
And I hope I stick in your mind 
And that you think of me sometimes 
Remember what you told me last night... 
I had such a good time 
We had the best time 
And I know... 
Morning sun shines through my window 
Evening comes and I'm still waiting here 
I get up and read the paper 
I'm just trying to move on
