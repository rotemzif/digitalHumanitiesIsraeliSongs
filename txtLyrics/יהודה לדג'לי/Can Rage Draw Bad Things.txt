I wonder if your rage can draw what we would call bad things 
Things like losing your wallet or things like bombs going off in your town 
Maybe it's better not to think about it 
Maybe it's better not to dwell on all the things that could happen 
Maybe it's a good idea to just be quiet 
Maybe it's better to just stand still...
