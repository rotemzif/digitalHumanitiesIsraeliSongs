You passed the quiz 
You've opened up your mind finally 
The trouble is that you've nowhere left to hide your heart 
Anymore 
What's hers was his 
Mark your territory if you can 
And realize this, that the shit's gonna hit the fan 
Just like the waves crash into the sand 
Ya know the shit's gonna hit the fan 
Real soon... 
Ya fight the war 
But the casualties are greater than you bargained for 
Then you hunt for more 
As the dawn bleeds red upon the fate you chose 
To be a door through which anyone can come at all 
Come on, you may be poor 
But you're not as poor as some 
Oh no you're not as poor as some 
Why don't you pour over me your greatest sum 
You know I've always been your greatest fan
