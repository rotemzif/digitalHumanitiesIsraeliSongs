I should take with me a pad of paper and a pencil when I'm not near you 
And write down all the things my heart proclaims are feelings to 
Express myself 
One thing just flows into another; you never know what to expect 
Macintosh computers are just too fucking hi-tech for me 
Give me an MT400 and I'll paint a song for you 
Your 1's and 0's are incredible but my analog tape is true 
"A man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest" 
Fuck! If I had more alcohol I'd be in my element
