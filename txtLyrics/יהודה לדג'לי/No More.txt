Why just the other day 
Destroyed your Book, page by page 
"catharsis" doesn't even begin to describe 
The feeling that it left inside me 
Prayer is a four-letter word 
When I scream and shout and start to curse 
It's pure and frightening what I have got to say 
But You can take it any way 
Break down all of the borders that I see 
Shut out all of the fear and misery 
I don't need it anymore 
Went to the Wall tonight 
And it was You I had in sight 
Just closed my eyes and let You wash over me 
Enjoying what it means to be free 
Break down all of the borders that I see 
Shut out all of the fear and misery 
I don't need it anymore
