Swimmin' lessons are not expensive if ya know where to go 
All ya gotta do is keep an eye open - you will know 
Vodka, vodka and gin are a good start for beginners 
Move on to the rye and scotch when you think you're ready 
I know what I'm talkin' about 
I know damn well what I'm sayin' to you 
Sky-divin' is somethin' you should try; just find your sky 
All ya gotta do is freefall into your mind 
Find yourself a dealer, preferably through a friend 
Hook yourself up with some people who have been there already 
I know what I'm talkin' about 
I know damn well what I'm sayin' to you 
Comin' down is such a drag when you're high 
Maybe you should try somethin' else 
What do you mean by that? I hope you don't mean religion? 
Oh, don't worry I've already tried that two times 
I mean, get yourself some kind of inspiration 
Through artistic, creative pleasure 
And when you open up your heart to this idea 
Maybe you will find somethin' that you never knew was there 
Ohhh, I know what I'm talkin' about 
yeah now I think I've bin there once or twice before 
I know damn well what I'm sayin' to you
