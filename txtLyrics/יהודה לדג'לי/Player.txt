You can call me a player 
Or you can call me whenever you want to make a new start 
Vampire slayer but I've got no intention of driving a stake 
through your heart 
Can't be your teacher 'cuz I'm my own damned student and 
I've got a lot left to learn 
I won't be a preacher - my religious bridges have all been 
burned 
Am I freakin' you out girl? Are things movin' too fast? 
I can't relieve the doubt you feel, it's somethin' from 
your past 
Something that won't last 
Something that must pass 
This too shall pass 
I love you girl...
