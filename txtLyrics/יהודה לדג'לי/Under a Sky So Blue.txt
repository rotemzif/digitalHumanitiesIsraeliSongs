Under a sky so blue wandering in a meadow with you 
Dreaming barefoot, hand in hand, with eyes closed 
The wind caressingly whispers through your wild hair 
As the pregnant earth softly rolls beneath our naked toes 
Inside a peasant inn you sip your iced-tea 
I guzzle down my gin and watch you blissfully 
Not much to say but silence feels alright 
Nothing's something we can do all night
