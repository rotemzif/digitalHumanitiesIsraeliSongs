'tis the autumn of evolution 
When all systems like leaves must die 
Your weary institutions 
Break down with a final sigh 
To welcome a new age 
A springtime of fun 
Where emotion's the language of the soul 
To be spoken 
By me and you and everyone 
Rebirth comes through this destruction 
And then love will finally reign 
Say goodbye to your religions 
N' bid farewell to all the pain 
And welcome a new age 
A springtime of fun 
Where emotion's the language of the soul 
To be spoken 
By me and you and everyone
