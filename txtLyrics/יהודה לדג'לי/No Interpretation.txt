My legs take me to all manner of places 
I need to get 
Upon my beautiful, practical, environmentally-friendly 
Bicyclette 
My hands rape me at night beneath the all-knowing stars 
They seduce my emotions by caressing the heartstrings of my guitar 
Don't ask for an interpretation to this dream 
Don't ask me to explain myself again 
My heart is an instrument for gauging what you feel 
My mind's a justice of peace that discerns what is bullshit and what is real 
My mouth only speaks what is true for him and her, for you and me 
My eyes see beyond the future that your god has decreed 
Don't ask for an interpretation to this dream 
Don't ask me to explain myself again
