A few weeks has gone by
And I haven't kissed you yet
we know each other for a while
you are always in my head
our conversations are the best I've ever had
I feel no shame
you make me feel safe just by saying my name
I want you to come in slowly into my life
come in slowly, and I'll be alright
you've got the brownest eyes I have ever seen
your smile so sweet and kind
when I cried the other day like crazy you just held me for a while
see I dont want to be just friends I want much more
I want to show you how you changed me give you what you deserve
I want you to come in....
hope I'm lucky in this life
you can't tell until it's to late, too late
hope I'm blessed in this life
you can't make any plans
can't make any plans
