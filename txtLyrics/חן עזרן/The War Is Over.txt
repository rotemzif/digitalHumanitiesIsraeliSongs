well the war is over
nothing but a bitter taste in my mouth
iv'e been trying so hard to love you
for the past few months
what is it about you baby that makes me lose myself
I lost the war I lost you again guess I could use some help
some help from above
good god please, send me some love
Iv'e been walking around so hollow
can't shake away this blues my baby is gone and it's nothing but bad news
people say they have seen him around with that stupid girl holding hands
I don't know what to do anymore guess i could use some help
some help....
set me free
send me love
pure and kind
from above
cause without love I won't survive
