What about sunrise 
What about rain 
What about all the things 
That you said we were to gain... 
What about killing fields 
Is there a time 
What about all the things 
That you said was yours and mine... 
Did you ever stop to notice 
All the blood we've shed before 
Did you ever stop this notice 
This crying earth This weeping shore ? 
What have we done to the world 
Look what we've done 
What about all the peace 
That you pledge your only son... 
What about flowering fields 
Is there a time 
What about all the dreams 
That you said was yours and mine... 
Did you ever stop to notice 
All the children dead from war 
Did you ever stop to notice 
This crying earth This weeping shore 
I used to dream 
I used to glance beyond the stars 
Now I don't know where we are 
Although I know we've drifted far 
Hey, what about yesterday 
(what about us) 
What about the seas 
(what about us) 
The heavens are falling down 
(what about us) 
I can't even breathe 
(what about us) 
What about everything 
(what about us) 
I have given you 
(what about us) 
What about nature's worth 
(ooo,ooo) 
It's our planet's womb 
(what about us) 
What about animals 
(what about it) 
We've turned kingdoms to dust 
(what about us) 
What about elephants 
(what about us) 
Have we lost their trust 
(what about us) 
What about crying whales 
(what about us) 
We're ravaging the seas 
(what about us) 
What about forest trails 
(ooo, ooo) 
Burnt despite our pleas 
(what about us) 
What about the holy land 
(what about it) 
Torn apart by creed 
(what about us) 
What about the common man 
(what about us) 
Can't we set him free 
(what about us) 
What about children dying 
(what about us) 
Can't you hear them cry 
(what about us) 
Where do we go wrong 
(ooo, ooo) 
Someone tell me why 
(what about us) 
What about baby boy 
(what about it) 
What about the days 
(what about us) 
What about all their joy 
(what about us) 
What about the men 
(what about us) 
What about the crying man 
(what about us) 
What about abraham 
(what was us) 
What about death again 
(ooo, ooo) 
Do we give a damn
