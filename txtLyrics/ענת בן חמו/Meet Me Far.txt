The Days pass by and I 
Can’t even feel you passing by 
I can’t believe you’re real 
You’re like a dream through waking eyes 
Far, meet me far 
Meet me far 
Meet me far 
Far, meet me far 
Meet me far 
Meet me far 
Your touch can slow down time 
And even though you’re on my mind 
You’re all I need in life 
It’s you and me just drifting by 
Far, meet me far….
