Donâ€™t hide inside yourself
Please let me help
I've seen these things before,
You have no hope inside
Soft hands I'll lay on yours
I'll guide you through
And when night falls upon our day
I'll light your way
If I could replace
The look on your face
Cho.
Cause you hear only bad news
and you can't keep up no more
If you let me inside I'll light the dark,
you know that we can be strong
verse
Don't think about the worst
Try lying down
Inside your mind just rest' just sleep
Just give it time
If everything's gone
Just lean on my arm
Cho.
Cause you hear only bad news
and you can't keep up no more
If you let me inside I'll light the dark,
you know that we can be strong
Cause you hear only bad news
and you can't keep up no more
If you let me inside I'll light the dark,
you know that we can be strong
