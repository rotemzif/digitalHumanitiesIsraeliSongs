Yo! come from the holiest place on earth 
and still i don't believe in shit 
sticking my music in you for whatever it's worth 
you can use it or refuse it whatever you see fit 
got me an appetite for party tonite 
so i think i might go out despite slight fright 
pretending i'm alright gonna drown my fears 
intending to delight my soul down a beer 
gotta drive thru various random checkpoints 
they be looking thru my pockets for weapons n' joints 
at the entrance to the club i'm sure that you know this 
searched once again for explosives n' roaches 
all this just so i can get loaded 
where a whole bunch of buddies of mine exploded 
n' left me on this planet on my own 
fuck it- i think i'm gonna stay home, get stoned. 
I'm just a little man 
I come from the Middle East 
I wanna be a free man 
I ain't no gangsta no 
I'm just a little man 
coming from the Middle East 
I wanna be a free man 
I ain't no gangsta no 
If i were a bird i'd fly high in the sky 
and dump a big ass turd all over all religious 
sites 
like an activist get other birds to join in too 
til' everything would actually be covered in pooh 
so many close calls so many times i could've died 
now my brain cells feel like falafel- deep fried 
this ain't no fairy tale ain't no mother goose 
one thing's for sure - when hell really breaks loose 
i'm gonna be loungin' in the box seats 
residing in the town whre three religions meet 
and when they decide to clash 
n' burn this mother fuckin' shit hole to the ash 
i won't pass on the opportunity given to me 
to light a fat ass hash doobie that'll really screw me 
get real smashed... kick back... 
while i watch all types of pathetic fanatics attack. 
I'm just a little man 
coming from the Middle East 
I wanna be a free man 
I ain't no gangsta no
