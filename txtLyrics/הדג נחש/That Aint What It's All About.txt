Ladies and gentlemen, 
It's all about words 
That Aint What It's All About...
Whispering oh so softly - words 
Better than turkish cofffee - words 
Motoring in full speed - words 
Saltier than sunflower seeds - words 
Explaining as if in shock - words 
Husher than that first zip of Arak - words 
spitting out nasty spicy - words 
Hey hey hey, one two three 
be all that I can be 
Three years and four months in the israely army 
Proved to me without any doubt 
That Aint What It's All About...
Tickling - words 
Tattooing - words 
Verging - words 
Outdoing - words 
Visiting - words 
Voicing - words 
Wondering - words 
Working - words 
Never leave home without them 
Building an entire career around 'em 
Take my addiction wherever I go 
Pronunciation, fiction, 
Don't lose your grip 
Gonna take back my life 
And then my trip 
Trip trop stay out of my heart 
Words, they're my work art 
Chasing words all over the globe 
My love for words will never evolve 
Reviving my soul and my bank account 
by that ain't what it's all about 
That Aint What It's All About...
Words,wondering, pimping, poking 
Words questioning, cracking, cruel thing 
Words, ripping like a ring bing rope bing 
Words smiling, sniffing, smoking 
Words rolling down the mountains of Atlanta
That Aint What It's All About...
