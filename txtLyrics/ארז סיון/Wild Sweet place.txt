Should I give you a reason to come back home
What if all I want is to be alone
You don't know me you should
After so many years I would
The bitter tangle which I fled
Now I'm trying to embrace myself instead
No longer longing for love that will never be
I think of myself as plain history 
Oh, bound to find 
A wild sweet place
Oh, won't leave behind 
Not even a trace
A vague memory floating around
And all that I can feel is a hollow sound
Comes right at me through my fears
Soon as it does you disappear
Oh, bound to find 
A wild sweet place
Oh, won't leave behind 
Not even a trace
