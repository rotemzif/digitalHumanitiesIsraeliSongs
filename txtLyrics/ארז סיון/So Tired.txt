Lightning bolt reversals
Leave me shattered in their wake
The many small rehearsals
Of your final furious break
Thursday you want me
Friday you disappear
Saturday you miss me
Love script of the insincere. 
I'm so tired of your swinging 
Your yeses and your no's 
Your guesses and your woes 
Your open and your close Your I don't knows
I want to love and make love
 Give and take love 
Have true not fake love 
Build not break love 
But your words are bad checks             
Bouncing fears, cheating sex                   
Only true to your hide and seek               
Philosophy for the weak                         
Thursday you want me
Friday you disappear
Saturday you miss me 
Love script for insincere 
I'm so tired of your swinging 
Your yeses and your no's 
Your guesses and your woes 
Your open and your close Your I don't knows
Turning on a dime taking back what you said was mine
I'm so tired of your swinging 
Your yeses and your no's 
Your guesses and your woes 
Your open and your close Your I don't knows
