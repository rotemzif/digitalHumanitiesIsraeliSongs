Flying way up high
Don't have a need to say goodbye
Sleep upon a cloud
Leave that crowd down bellow
No, I don't care
I don't mind
Leaving Everything behind
No, I don't fit in
And I don't mind
Leaving,
Everything behind
Sand Beneath my feet 
I can feel the heat
Where shall I go
Diving through the Dead Sea
Oh it forces me to float
No, I don't care
I don't mind
Leaving Everything behind
No, I don't fit in
And I don't mind
Leaving,
Everything behind
