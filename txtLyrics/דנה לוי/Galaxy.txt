This color in the sky drives me out of my mind
Not blue not green, something in-between
Shaking my soul, and I wonder
yeah I wonder
And there's a blue fluid light spilling out of the sky
And a trail of pearls welcomes me by
From one galaxy to another galaxy to another one 
From one galaxy to another galaxy to another one 
I am a dot spotlight that’s spinning around space and time
From one galaxy to another galaxy to another one
And I no longer have to carry my heavy weight around
No, I no longer have to carry my weight around
But there's a color in the sky
drives me out of my mind
The speed of light, it's all around 
I'm travelling about
From one star to another one
And there's a trail of pearls, its leading me up
From one galaxy to another galaxy to another one 
From one galaxy to another galaxy to another one 
I am a dot spotlight that’s spinning around space and time
From one galaxy to another galaxy to another one
And I no longer have to carry my heavy weight around
No, I no longer have to carry my weight around
