You decided to part
When you lost your dart
To another woman's heart
Because I was smart
You decided to part
When you lost your dart
To another woman's heart
You can come or go
Stay or leave
It's your give
Quick quick
Quick quick
You decided to stray
When you lost your way
To another woman's play
Because I could stay
You decided to stray
When you lost your way
To another woman's play
You can come or go
Stay or leave
It's your give
Quick quick
Quick quick
