Humidity's rising barometer's getting low
According to all sources the street's the place to go
Coz tonight for the first time at just about half past ten
For the first time in history it's gonna start raining men
It's raining men Hallelujah it's raining men Amen
I'm gonna go out, I'm gonna let myself get absolutely soaking wet
God bless Mother Nature, she's a single woman too
She took on a heaven and she did what she had to do
She taught every angel to rearrange the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy
It's raining men
It's raining men
It's raining men
I feel stormy weather moving in about to begin
Hear the thunder don't you lose your head
Rip off the roof and stay in bed
God bless Mother Nature she's a single woman too
She took on a heaven and she did what she had to do
She taught every angel to rearrange the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy
It's raining men, Hallelujah, it's raining men, every specimen, 
Tall, blond, dark and mean, tough and tough and strong and lean. 
It's raining men
