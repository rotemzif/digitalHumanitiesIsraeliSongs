Deep,
Get down underneath
Hands on maps.
We are all invalids.
Honk, honk now
to the flood
hand in hand.
See, I am on top of things
Except the best thing.
You're my witness
When I'll see your face again?
I can be your wilderness
And you can be my accent.
I'm simply built with layers
But I'm feeling like an accident.
Afraid to hatch
And find a better world out there.
There is something about your method.
See, no one lives forever
Unless you find
The little things you would die for.
Home, home is where
You belong.
Among your trees.
Among your friends.
hope, hoping that you'll find
A way to get close to me.
Still I am on top of things
Except the best thing.
You're my witness
When I'll see your face again?
I can be your wilderness
And you can be my accent.
I'm simply built with layers
But I'm feeling like an accident.
Afraid to hatch
And find a better world out there.
There is something about your method.
See, no one lives forever
Unless you find
The little things you would die for.
It is wanderlust!
When I'll see your land again?
I can be your Indian
And you'll be my American.
