Who is like You in this living world,
who is like You the heavens above,
who will last for eternity, who
created infinity. x2
Shir HaShirim song of songs my
own version, it is for You I long. I
see You split the sea, listen please.
Lift me up, dust me off, get me
glistening crystal clean. Heat seek
missling, to Your rhythemings.
Different things implement in me
persistently. The case is to face the
place as close to face to face as the
case will allow now. I bow down for
no other, proud now, I represent my
beloved, thoughts and feelings
covered. Smothered, wrapped up in
your blanket tight, warm belief at
night. Every time is right. With the
diamond like ring exchange of
things, changed my being came
from extreme feelings, became me.
Seized control then You took hold
who of my heart head body then
you claimed my soul. Oh, it doesn›t
end, eternity infinity, overwhelming
y›all beyond outer limitary.
Who is like You in this living world,
who is like You the heavens above,
who will last for eternity, who
created infinity. x2
I got this infinity infatuation that
impacts the saichel, takes me long
gone way beyond impatient. I can›t
eat, can›t sleep, can›t breath, can›t
bring my feet to where they need to
bring me. Equally you reflect the
best of what I project. Connect the
head to chest, express tremendous.
Without you horrendous, endless, I
can›t defend this, this outpour
relentless. Send the kiss then You
bring me back. Three steps forward
after three steps back. When we
first danced You gave me whiplash.
Double take to neck break, straight
slave, I’m with that...admit that.
I need You now, I breathe You now,
I live and bleed You now, in every
season now. Till the end of days I›ll
chase Your ways like I run the race,
olympic sprint just to catch Your
grace.
Who is like You in this living world,
who is like You the heavens above,
who will last for eternity, who
created infinity. x2
Ending: Three six nine, bless my
wine. Everybody know they better
recognize. Three two one, son of a
gun when it all breaks down it is
you I love. Six one three, perfect
dream, everybody knows that Your
moving me. Two four eight open the
gate I’m moving in let me in Your
space. Three six nine, bless my
wine. Everybody know they better
recognize. Three two one, son of a
gun when it all breaks down it is
You I love.
