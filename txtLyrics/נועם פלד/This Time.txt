I know we've got problems 
moving in different styles 
but won't you smile to me now, 
for the sake of old times 
I know we've got problems 
something inside won't keep still 
but let me assure you there's nothing 
that can keep you out of me 
and though we're never apart 
I feel the urge to resist 
I'm telling you I've loved every second of it 
Oh I insist 
that one day you will come my way 
so indifferent, so unsure 
then I'll know what I've made you stay for 
this time 
I know we've got issues 
listening to different vibes 
but there's one sound, oh one sound 
that hides the need to analyze 
and though we're never apart 
I feel the urge to resist 
I'm telling you I've loved every second of it 
Oh I insist 
that one day you will come my way 
so indifferent, so unsure 
then I'll know what I've made you stay for 
this time
