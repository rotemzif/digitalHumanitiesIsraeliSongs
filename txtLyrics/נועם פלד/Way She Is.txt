There she goes 
With nothing on but her pride 
Stick it sharp in your side 
And let it bleed deeply 
There it shows 
there's nothing ahead but goodbye 
but leaving it all, there, behind 
and biting it slickly 
Now ask your self 
Do you remember 
The way it was before 
So how do you step outa this song 
with no hidden agenda 
just thinking you'd bend a 
little rule, or two, or three 
Well, how do you step outa this song 
To figure it clearer, 
just hoping you'd see her, 
one more time , 
the way she is 
There she walks 
The soft touch of her tender skin 
Nothing now you can win 
her ships invaded your harbor 
There it locks 
The memory clenches so tight 
Some things you just won't fight 
Just try to end it as quickly 
Now ask your self 
Do you want to remember 
The way it was before 
So how do you step outa this song...
