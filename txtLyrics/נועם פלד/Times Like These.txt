People always say there's gotta be a way 
for keeping you in without having you stay 
they're trying to get over you 
Well I have found the gift of awe 
I'm keeping you in but I'm letting you go 
I'm trying to get over you 
Just trying to get over you 
And everytime I hear the sound 
of you in my mind 
I know that I've found 
some peace tonight 
And I won't let you hear 
what time has taled 
and I won't let you see 
how life has paled 
in times like these tonight 
When I awake from a baffling dream 
There's no doubt that it's you I've seen 
Just trying to get over you 
A flash of thought gets weaved with care 
Makes me more than sure that your hand was there 
Just trying to get over you 
And everytime I hear the sound... 
And I won't let you hear... 
And I won't let you see 
how I fall for the sound 
of you in mind 
just trying to get over you 
Just wishing I'd gotten over you...
