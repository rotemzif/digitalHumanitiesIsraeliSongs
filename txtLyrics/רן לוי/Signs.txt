You will find 
Every other moment you’re away – that’s fine! 
Every other moment you’re away 
Just believe in me always. 
Come with me now 
There is no more sorrow 
It’s a life of how 
Waking up tomorrow to the light 
Just believe in me always 
All of this time you will find you’re courageous 
All of these years passing by 
I pray for the sun to shine and be outrageous 
All of this time and the signs 
Your love is sending me now. 
Fantasyland! 
Tender and some ego is life we have 
Tender and some ego all this time 
Just believe in me always… 
I’m a miserable guy 
So follow all the others 
And don’t listen to my 
Instructions and deductions all this time 
And don’t believe in me always.
