It's late and I sit here by myself,
Running pictures through my head.
Remember the day I left you alone,
I never thought it would be forever.
I dream that you right here in my arms,
To wake me up when tomorrow comes.
Instead I have pieces of my heart,
And I'm missing your love.
Now that you're gone,
it's hard to find a place where I belong.
It hurts but I admit,
That I was wrong.
I made a mistake,
But it's a little too late.
I thought I need time here on my own,
But I never meant like this.
You were the one who picked me up,
And now whenever I come undone.
All I have left, all the things you touched,
And I'm missing your love.
Now that you're gone,
it's hard to find a place where I belong.
It hurts but I admit,
That I was wrong.
I made a mistake,
But it's a little too late.
Now that I'm broken inside,
And all my tears won't never bring you back.
I'm learning to live without you,
And I'll always be stronger.
Now that you're gone,
it's hard to find a place where I belong.
It hurts but I admit,
That I was wrong.
I made a mistake,
But its a little too late.
Now that you're gone
