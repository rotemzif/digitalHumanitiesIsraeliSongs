We finally made it through 
All the skys above are blue 
It's how it will always stay 
As long as you are here 
Loving me 
In my mind this one thing I know 
Is $ 
You've raised all my feels 
And wanna tell the world exactly what I found 
You bring me 
Joy, joy, joy 
Joy, everyday 
Joy, joy, joy 
Joy, everyday 
That's what you do 
You, with you I feel so sure 
You hold the keys to thousands dreams 
It all comes true fore me and you 
Cause high, is how you got me feelin' 
Losin' high 
Yes I wanna tell the world 
How I feel 
'Cause you bring me 
Joy, joy, joy 
Joy, everyday 
You bring me 
Joy, joy, joy 
Joy, everyday 
That's what you do 
It's what you do 
Oh! 
I'm gonna try 
To make you understand 
I spent my happiness, the best on your love 
Baby baby baby 
I know these girls 
Will try to hit on you

You bring me joy 
Joy, everyday 
You bring me 
Joy, joy, joy 
Joy, everyday 
Baby you bring me 
Joy, oooh joy
