Tell me I'm the one 
Show me all your love 
She cannot compare 
To the way I make you feel 
Nights I spent alone 
Wondering what went wrong 
All this time I'm trying to 
Turn this into something real 
I try to forgive you 
When I'm starring in your eyes 
But It's hard to forget 
All the times you made me cry 
And I don't know the man I thought I knew 
And I hope that I can fall in love again 
I keep wishing that 
You'll start convincing me 
To try and trust again 
Part of me is missing you 
How can I forget 
Surrender you my heart 
Broken promises 
Sometimes it seems that's all we are 
I try to forgive you... 
I think about the days we had 
and boy it was just you and me 
at times I wish I could go back 
to the first night 
it's cold without you next to me 
boy,when you left I lost myself 
and I now I need just to learn within me 
how to love again 
I try to forgive you... 
Tell me I'm the one 
Show me all your love 
She cannot compare 
To the way I make you feel
