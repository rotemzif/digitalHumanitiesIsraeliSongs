Here we are, so close 
But you're so far 
And long to be where you are 
So don't you stray when i told it baby 
Don't do the things I will not do 
You know I miss your love 
Each time we go away 
You should know it's true 
I only have eyes for you 
You should know it's true 
I only have eyes for you 
You set me free 
To let my spirit fly 
I can saw way up in the sky 
Nothing seems impossible for me to do 
If only i tell you 
I want to join the ride 
I lest you i felt by my side 
You should know it's true, yeah 
I only have eyes for you 
You should know it's true 
I only have eyes for you 
I hope and pray that it will stay this way baby 
Not for a lifetime 'cause you bring me so much joy 
It makes me feel like a child with a brand new toy 
You should know it's true 
I only have eyes for you, baby 
You should know it's true 
I only have eyes for you 
You should know it's true, yeah 
I only have eyes for you
