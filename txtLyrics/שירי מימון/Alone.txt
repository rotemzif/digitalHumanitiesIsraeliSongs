Hello, I just called to say goodbye 
This time, I ain't changing my mind 
So don't try 
Don't trying to play on my desire 
'Cause your cheating, and lying 
Already put off the fire 
Many times, we've been down this road 
I figured out, there's nowhere else to go 
I just wanna be alone 
We don't belong together 
I just wanna be alone 
I'm turning off the phone 
I just wanna be alone 
Nothing lasts forever 
I'm better off, standing on my own 
Goodluck, I hope you find what you need 
But as for me 
I know in life there's no guarantee 
When I go to roll the dice 
I'll makes some mistakes 
But I won't make them twice 
Many times, I've trusted you freely 
I've drawn the line 
I know what's best for me 
I just wanna be alone 
We don't belong together 
I just wanna be alone 
I'm turning off the phone 
I just wanna be alone 
Nothing lasts forever 
I'm better off, standing on my own 
Now I know for sure 
What I didn't know before 
And once again 
A chapter ends and another one begins 
Now I may not be wise 
But I've opened up my eyes 
I'll be fine, right now's my time 
I know I'll love again 
I just wanna be alone 
We don't belong together 
I just wanna be alone 
I'm turning off the phone (oooooo' 
I just wanna be alone 
Nothing lasts forever 
I'm better off, standing on my own 
I just wanna be alone 
I just wanna be alone 
Nothing lasts forever 
I'm better off 
Standing on my own
