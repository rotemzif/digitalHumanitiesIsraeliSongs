Long are the days
When you're turning away
From the reasons you strung
Long is the way
When you're aching to say
But your teeth bite your tongue
Loud is the wind
In your ears as you spin
As you look for the sun
Loud are the skies
As you thunder your cries
When your prayers are sung
Hard is the floor
As the waves pound the shore
Of your wounds
Roll up your sleeve
It's hard to believe 
But it's you
Love it or leave it
You got to believe it
My Oh My! It hurts sometimes
My Oh My! It hurts sometimes
I think I’m running out of time
Before I’m gonna lose my mind
Slow is the night
When you reach for the light
But the Dark lingers on
Slow is the bite
Of the words that you write
When it’s finally dawn
How can you swim
When the waters are streaming 
In you
Roll up your sleeve
Now love it or leave it
It's you
Love it or leave it
You got to believe it
My Oh My! It hurts sometimes
My Oh My! It hurts sometimes
I think I’m running out of time
Before I’m gonna lose my mind
