Cyclamen, you're holding it in again
There's winter in every spring
It's time to let go
Cyclamen, the temperature’s rising again
But you're tuber is absorbing the rain
Continues to grow
I know I am dying
Still I'm gonna go trying
I’ll make it better
It's over. It's over. It's over.  
Cyclamen, it's hard to breath ‘cause the air
Is filled with your prayers again
You’ve got to let go
Cyclamen, Time will always be lighter than Pain
It floats away from your stem
You're left with a bulb
I know I am dying
Still I'm gonna go trying
I’ll make it better
It's over. It's over. It's over.  
It's over. It's over. It's over.  It's over. It's over. It's over. It's over. It's over. It's over.
