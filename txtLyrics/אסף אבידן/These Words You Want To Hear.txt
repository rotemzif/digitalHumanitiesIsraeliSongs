Don't you think it's time you get on over that?
Don't you think you had enough? I mean, I know you had it rough,
But that pansy-fancy way of looking grim all through the day and night?
Is something wrong my dear? Have I said it way to clear?
Then let me whisper in your ear, all these words I know are wrong
But for the sake of writing song - Here is what I guess you want to hear
Somewhere up there, the sky is blue for you
Somewhere out there, there's something new to do
Somebody loves you 
Somebody loves you
Tell me do you think you have some exclusivity 
On every shadow of regret that's lurking in proximity 
To what you think your life should be$ But if you close your eyes you’ll see
That there is nothing for you here, still the only words you hear are - 
Somewhere up there, the sky is blue for you
Somewhere out there, there's something new to do
Somebody loves you
Somebody loves you
Now tell me how about we maybe switch things for a change?
I will lie down in denial and you can have this page
It's condescending and it's sad, you're not the only one that's had 
A life like this, I'm sorry dear, but it’s what everybody wants to hear
