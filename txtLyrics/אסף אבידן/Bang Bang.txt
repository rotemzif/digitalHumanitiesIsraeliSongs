I love you like the roots in the sand
I love you like God likes his plan
I love you like death loves a man
I love you like a gun in my hand
Bang Bang Bang I'm back again
I love you like scalpel loves flesh
I love you like blood that is fresh
I love you like a Jew on the run
I love you like my hand on a gun
Bang Bang Bang I'm back again
Ooh ooh I can't think about anything but you
Ooh ooh That's how I love, love, love you
I love you like a chisel and stone
I love you like a needle and bone
I love you a god loves his son
I love you like my hand on a gun
Bang Bang Bang I'm back again
