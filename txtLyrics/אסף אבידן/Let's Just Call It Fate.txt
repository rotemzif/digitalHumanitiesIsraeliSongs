Tears are clouding up a sunny day
And I wish itâ€™d turn up any other way
But I don't think that you'd care
If I stepped out of your hair
And you'd find me anywhere - but here
I wish it wasn't so
I'll say it again - I wish it wasn't so
But I don't think that you'd mind
If I left this room behind
And I'd step outside to find - some other place
Let's say that it's OK, and just leave it at that
Things are different than they seem
Everybody's looking from the outside, but we're both stuck within
And I'd wish that you would say
That you wanted me to stay
And we'll find some other way but this
Let's say that it's OK, and just leave it at that
Maybe I could wait
But I think that it's too late
So let's just call it Fate - from here
