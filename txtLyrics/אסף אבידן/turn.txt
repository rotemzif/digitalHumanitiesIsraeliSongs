It's five in the morning where you are
You're learning a language, beginning with "far"
I'm glad you're awake now, and picking your scars
We do it all backwards, wherever we are
Turn.
Turn around.
You're living on the breadcrumbs of love that you found
We were never ashamed love off the ground
I'm changing my skin now from white into brown
There's sun in the winter now, things are turning around
Turn.
Turn around.
Turning up, turning in my dream. I've come a long way.
Turning up. Turn. Turn it again.
