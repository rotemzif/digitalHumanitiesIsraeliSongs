On a train ride from some place bad, to some place little better
In-between my youth and manhood, was the place I met her
She was just a skinny, brown-eyed girl, with a hunger for tomorrow
And I was then obese by pain, I had all that I could swallow
Oh fair haired travelling girl
Keep on travelling on
Oh fair haired travelling girl
It's just the seat that you have is wrong
Her eyes were packing passed regrets, in her lips there was redemption
And she mistook my coat for love, as she wore it for affection
As she took the seat beside me, I inhaled all of her laughter
And she forgot there is a past, while I forgot there is an after
Oh fair haired travelling girl
Keep on travelling on
Oh fair haired travelling girl
It's just the seat that you have is wrong
On a train ride from some place gone, to some place almost certain
In-between my flesh and bone, was the place I met her
And wrapped up in my coat of shame, she laid there sleeping tightly
And as the train pulled to another stop, I knew that she'd go on without me
Oh fair haired travelling girl
Keep on travelling on
Oh fair haired travelling girl
It's just the seat that you have is wrong
