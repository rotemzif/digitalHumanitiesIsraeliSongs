She rots in a cage of your make 
Far away from your eyes
You stripped all her powers to break 
With your love and your lies
Marooned on an island 
You gave her a gun and a choice
But she's crazy about you
She still waits around for your voice
What kind of sick, sick love is this, that you left her to die?
She rots in a cage of your make
As she waits for a sign
Your gun in her hand
But there isn’t a choice in her mind
Now there's guilt in your veins 
‘Cause there's guilt in your heart
So there's guilt in your blood 
But you're oceans apart
What kind of sick, sick love is this, that you left her to die?
What kind of sick, sick love is this?
