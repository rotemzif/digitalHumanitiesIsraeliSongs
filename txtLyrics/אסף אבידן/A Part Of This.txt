It's understood that you don't want to be a part of this
Although you could, but you have grown apart from this
And I for one am sick of running in these circles dear
And I for one would love the sound of your voice in my ear
"It's crystal clear, although I'm here, I'm not a part of this"
It's over due, so lets both put an end to this
You know it's true, why don't you put an end to this?
Our time is done, what was is gone, it's only memory
That keeps us on, let's end this song with your voice telling me
"It's crystal clear, although I'm here, I'm not a part of this"
I think I knew that it will have to end like this
I'm blaming you, but I'm as much to blame in this
It seems my heart right from the start was always split in two
It is so far from what you are, and what I made of you
"It's crystal clear, I wasn't here, I’m not a part of this…I’m not a part of this!
It's crystal clear, I wasn't here… I've never been a part of this"
