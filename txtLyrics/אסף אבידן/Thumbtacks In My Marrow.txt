Wait, don’t stop
You have gotten to me – at last
I know I broke your fall but I cant repent the past
It hurts
Thumbtacks in my marrow
I rest on old familiar runes that I cant recall
Leave a hint
Of your broken image
Before I shed this crackled glass and take the final leap
Into the womb of all rusted feathers
And I'll see you when I am born into your world
Again.
