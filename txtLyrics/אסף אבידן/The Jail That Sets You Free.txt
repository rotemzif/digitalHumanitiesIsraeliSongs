Lately Iâ€™ve been picking at the fossil in my throat
It's hard to stare into the ocean, and to try to stay afloat
Now don't upset yourself due to the changing of my mood
I'm hard to please sometimes - I'm hard to please sometimes 
I'm on a staircase to the bottom of the bottom of my soul
Although my feet are still connected they are out of my control
Now please refrain yourself from worrying on my behalf
I'm hard to understand sometimes - I'm hard to understand sometimes
Honey come with me, it's just you and me
Baby believe it's as simple as can be
I will be the jail that sets you free - I will be the jail that sets you free
I'm shuffling underneath my pillow for the bed-crumbs of my mind
It's hard to look there for a future, when I left it all behind
Please don't condescend and say you've heard this one before
I'm hard to please sometimes - I'm hard to please sometimes 
And while you're offering a handshake to a goddamn amputee
I feel my phantom heart is scratching in a train-wreck memory
Please don't try to cure me with on rectifying glance
I'm hard to understand sometimes - I'm hard to understand sometimes
Honey come with me, it's just you and me
Baby believe it's as simple as can be
I will be the jail that sets you free
I will be the jail that makes you
I will be the jail that breaks you
I will be the jail that sets you free
