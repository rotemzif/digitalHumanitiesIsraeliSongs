You and I we used to ride up and
down the country side
I came from the east, you were
from the west
I picked you up I took you home,
the radio played your favorite song
You said hold me ‘till the sun goes down
Come on girl, you shouldn’t worry cause
 in love there is no hurry
We used to say 'forever and a day'
I made you laugh, I knew I was home, 
baby, I’m never leaving you alone
God, I hate to say that I was wrong
All the songs we used to play, well, 
I don’t hear them anymore
I’ve been trying to forget you, 
I’ve been trying to let go
Real gone, but my heart keeps asking 
when ya’ coming home?
Mornings racing black and blue, 
I was hooked and so were you
Night time falls we’d paint the town red
Dreams they come in shapes and forms, 
love has no boundaries where ever it roams
I say I’m fine even though I’m not
All the colors you have shown me, 
I don’t see them anymore
Now every time I think of you, 
it makes me die a little more
Real gone, but my heart keeps 
asking when ya’ coming home?
Now sometimes I take a break, 
on the outskirts of town not too far away
I like it there, but I never go inside
I see her now and then, the more 
things change the more they stay the same
Can you see us having a good time
All the flowers you have grown, 
I can’t smell them anymore
And I climbed up the evergreen, 
it’s so sad to live alone
Real gone, but my heart keeps 
asking when ya coming
