Bells were chiming, chiming 
You are not really so charming, charming 
You just happen to have a nice face 
Crows were cowing, cowing 
But I don't want just your body, body 
Coz it all leads to certain disgrace 
If the hand that you hold isn't moving 
And your man leaves but scent in your bed 
You just have to believe that it's over 
You just have to believe that it's dead 
And you go on your own way instead 
Walls were falling, falling 
But I never heard you calling, calling 
Coz when you call you crawl down on your face 
If you're walking on eggshells and needles 
And you're sick of holding your breath 
You just have to believe that it's over 
You just have to give it a rest 
When your pillow is made of sandpaper 
For his presence is lesser and less 
Did you know you were one of my heroes? 
Do you care, you were one of the best
