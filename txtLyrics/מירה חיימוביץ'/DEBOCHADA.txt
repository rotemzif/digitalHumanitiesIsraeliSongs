fascinated by this smile
It’s such a funny smile
It’s gonna turn into big laughter
In a little while
Her face a blaze of fire
Well such a beauty I admire
Emotion and desire
And a song that will start from your foolish heart
Capricious and delicious
She is the pepper and she is the salt
It’s the smell of onion baking
A thought of native woman shaking
Rice and beans are serving soon
Turn on the light in the room.
It is the nerves it is the prose
A music to compose
A silver lace a woman’s face
In such a silly pose
I sit back I’m relaxing
As things go by and time is passing
In the ringing of her laughter
And the teasing that comes after
In the ringing of her laughter
And the teasing that comes after
And her dance is like a fire
A little wind will lift it higher
Playing samba with a spoon
We’re gonna fly to the moon
I feel so fine I feel so good!
I never thought I would
Live all my dreams and dream my life
In such a silly mood
I sit back I’m relaxing
As things go by and time is passing
In the ringing of her laughter
And the teasing that comes after
In the ringing of her laughter
And the teasing that comes after
Her face a blaze of fire
Well such a beauty I admire
Emotion and desire
And a song that will start from your foolish heart
Capricious and delicious
She is the pepper and she is the salt
In the ringing of her laughter
And the teasing that comes after
Desca Debo………..
