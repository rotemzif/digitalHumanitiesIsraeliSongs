I feel like the wind has decided to enter my body and blow
Currents of wild fresh air
And a breeze below
And just like the wind of the subway has lifted up Marilyn’s dress
That’s how I feel myself
So admired
I'd like to let go be a little bit scandalous simply be free
It's my nudity It's me!
The wind has been wakin’ a dream up in me
and I'm feeling so real
and I am feeling I'm so desired
I wish for the breeze that caresses my knees
and is dancin’ in me
forever to leave my soul so inspired
I'd like to let go be a little bit scandalous simply be free
It's my nudity It's me!
The wind has been wakin’ a dream up in me
and I'm feeling so real
and I am feeling I'm so desired
I wish for the breeze that caresses my knees
and is dancin’ in me
always to leave my soul so inspired
And just like the wind in the subway that lifted up Marilyn’s dress
That’s how I feel myself
So admired!
I wish for the breeze that caresses my knees
and is dancin’ in me
forever to leave my soul so inspired
