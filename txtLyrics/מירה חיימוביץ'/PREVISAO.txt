Imagine you come back to me so intoxicated
The same old way you break my heart and don’t expect to be hated
You hold me in your passionate way, you’re dizzy, drunk and crazy for love
You pass out on me and I feel your body right up above
Imagine you wake up the morning right after the wildest storm
You’re saying that the liqueur is gone but the game we’re playing’s still on
You’re begging to come back to me to my thighs to my body heat
Your voice is so humble like you know already you’re on the lead
It’s you who is drinking and it’s me who’s getting dizzy
It’s you who is pleading and I fall for you so easy
You’re sleeping under my blankets and drinking my coffee too
Oh where is my bashful love now it’s gone with morning dew
And now, and now I jump into this phase of living my life with you
Forgive, I forgive cause I’ve got nothing better to do
This silly creature my heart is getting used to this old pain
And everything’s just getting ready to start all over again.
