Every day he’s doing everything the same
Six in the morning he’s calling my name
Smiling his smile with the same little hint
he’s kissing my lips and I can taste the mint
Every day he’s telling me to take good care
Saying the things that men will only dare
he will be coming for dinner at eight
His kisses will taste like coffee he’ll be late
All day I’m thinking my life is such a mess
If I could say no I would live without stress
Noon I feel I’m at the end of my rope
Eating my lunch I’m clearly out of hope
Eight in the evening as everyone expects
he will be walking in right through the gates
And he’s dying to make love to me again
And he’s kissing with passion and with pain
All night long he doesn’t let me off his sight
I cannot breath he is holding me tight
Midnight he swears he will always be mine
he’s biting my lips and I can taste the wine
