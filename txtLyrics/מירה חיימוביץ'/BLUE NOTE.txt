So it seems that god himself
had taught you how to play the guitar.
He gave you the tone, the song, the rhythm
So you'll be a star
I adore creating music too
The way I'm playing it with you
And I know
Improvization is happiness
Yes, It's solitude
I confess
playing through those last few verses
Your last round in closing phase
The entire city lost their senses
You're the song, the sky, the jazz
Fly with your song all over the city
Sing for the people
It is sunset the poem's ending
Open your eyes, it's time for landing
