If I tell you all the stars are in your eyes now
If I tell you all the rainbows make you smile tonight
If I tell you that the moon is made of gold and it’s always bright
If I tell you that my heart is made of laughter
If I tell you that my arms can touch the wind with love
If I tell you that my lips will melt like snow landin’ on your eyes
Say that I’m dreamin’
But I know it in my heart
Stay ‘cause I’m feelin’
Together we will fly forever high
If I tell you that my hair is made of flowers
If I tell you that my voice is like the river wide
If I tell you I’m the ocean will you dive deep inside my heart?
