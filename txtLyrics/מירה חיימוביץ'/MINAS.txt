Don’t go away
My love I really want you to stay
It wasn’t easy you know ‘cause life is never so
I know
Don’t go away
There’s one more thing I wanted to say
So please don’t go away all alone
There’re so many things we planned to do
But never followed through
There’re so many words we should have said
But never dared to say
And now you want to go
Darling
Don’t go away
If only you could stay one more day
We’ll make it happen you know cause love is always so
I know
Don’t go away
There’s one more game I wanted to play
So please don’t go away all alone
So many songs we have to sing
And many bells to ring
There’re so many words we should have said
And darling we will say
But now you want to go
Please don’t go…..
