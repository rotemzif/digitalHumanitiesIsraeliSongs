Never Ever
Never say forever
Never Ever
Never say forever
I never hear you saying like before
The words I love you no one says no more
Whatever happened to those simple words
They disappeared like heaven and I feel that
Never ever
Never say forever
Never ever
Never say forever
Stars are shining in the sky
And in the moonlight you can never hide
Try to look me in the eye
And you’ll be mind tonight
(you) never stay to see the sun
Always being on the run
(you) make up stories just for fun
No one ever told me that you’re so
Clever…
Ever…
Never say forever
Never ever
Never say forever
…
You think you can fool me, but I know all about you!
I know your game, I am playing it too.
You see – I am the one holding the cards here.
You think you are smart,
You think you are - clever
