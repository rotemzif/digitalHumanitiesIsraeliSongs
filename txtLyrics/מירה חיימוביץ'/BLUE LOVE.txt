Sometimes I think Love is amazing
Almost as painful as it's crazy
Making us mad 'cause we’re feeling
Believing, deceiving, giving
Not receiving.
It’s so insane,
You try again to beat it,
Cheat it and defeat it
Then it kicks you
Crazy it leaves you
Sometimes I find
That love is not always blind
It takes you right from behind
And deep inside your pretty mind
It hits you.
With so much pain
Will you explain
Please do!
How do you make a dream come true?
