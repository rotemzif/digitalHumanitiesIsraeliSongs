Play your beat!
my mission complete this beat raised my heat
my mission complete this beat raised my heat
I`d like to admit
you've raised my heat
and pushed my sense
breaking my defense
I get confused, forget the rules
my heart and body
Playing in this party
Only passion, no blame
just devotion no shame
till the end of the game
you got to understand
I want you near me, I can`t
control myself, no! I can`t!
you`re like a roller coaster baby 
got me spinning again
I have to confess
Boy, you pushed my sense
and raised my heat
nothing can`t compete
Since that you came
I'm lost in a fairy tale
don't want to get out so hot inside
I like to admit
you've raised my heat
and pushed my sense
breaking my defense
I get confused, forget the rules
my heart and body
Playing in this party
