baby I'm not you enemy
I gave you everthing that I'v had inside of me
I'm sorry but I'v run out all off my energy
to what you'v got I don't think that I have the remedy
tell me why,you'r never satisfied
from anything that I ever done for you (eh eh)
you'r always scared,like its kind of spell
and there is anything that I can do.
I gave you all my heart,but you didnt care
you took and throw it away,(eh eh eh)
and now you'r sorry but,its always the same
I think that this time,its too damn late
