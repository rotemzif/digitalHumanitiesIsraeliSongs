get them bubbles with fingers stroke 
they do no harm, no need to poke 
smells like clean floor on friday noon 
up it floats so happy balloon 
you had to go and that's ok 
millions of love sending your way 
give me a call wherever you live 
millions of love 
every friday noon I receive 
deep sleep for ten minutes I fall 
relating to nothing at all 
worlds in bubbles meet with a kiss 
I'm on one end 
god don't wake me up on this 
you had to go and that's ok 
millions of love sending your way 
give me a call wherever you live 
millions of love 
every friday noon I receive 
over now, 
you dream it's gone 
way up high 
over 
you had to go 
so give me a call
