Tell me what you feel inside 
Tell me why I had to cry 
Why these tears are in my eyes 
All alone those lonely nights 
And now you see that I was right 
To start to feel and compromise 
I can't feel you 
I can't see you 
So take me and tell me why 
I can't feel you 
I can't see you 
So take me and tell me why 
I can't feel you now 
Can't see you now 
So take me high and tell me why 
Tell me what you feel inside 
Tell me why I had to cry 
Why these tears are in my eyes 
All alone those lonely nights 
And now you see that I was right 
To start to feel and compromise 
I hear you 
I had a dream of you 
I see you 
You got me so confused 
No mather what I do 
I still believe in you 
So tell me what to do 
I can't stop loving you 
You got me so confused
