It's allright! I'm gonna find mr. Right!
I thought that you are the one with whom I'll spend out my life,
felt so lucky I won, but the you stabbed in the knife.
I know I worth more than to be wasting my time with you...
When you first looked in my eyes, it seemed we're meant to be,
but you were full of lies which I couldn't see.
I tried for so long, and gave chances which you blew...
Now I know it's wrong, you have been breaking my heart for too long,
I must be strong, I really need to move on, that's why I'm singing this song,
I'm done with this fight, oh will I meet mr. Right tonight?
We'll be holding on tight, together forever - our love will shine bright!
You were nothing but a fake,
full of lies, a thilthy snake,
my eyes were shut, but now I'm awake
and I know it's time to break.
