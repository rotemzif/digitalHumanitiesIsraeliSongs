You're standing lonesome at the end of the club - it's no good,
Step up, join us, be a part of the crowd and let go, let the music enter your soul...
Don't be so heavy, start moving your feet, set them free,
Put on a smile, can you feel the beat and just flow, free your mind, release all control...
And never don't...
Don't give it up! You can shine child! You've got it in you and you have to let go.
Feel so high! But that requires you start by lifting your legs from the floor...
So don't give up! You can...
