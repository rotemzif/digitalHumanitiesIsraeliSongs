Once again i bumped my head
on the corner of the bed
what you gonna do?
what you gonna do?
Once again i bumped my head
once again I'm playing dead
what you gonna do?
what you gonna do?
Leave me here
don't come near
Once again i bumped my head
once again you say it's sad
what you gonna do?
what you gonna do?
Once again i lost my head
put my heart up there instead
what you gonna do?
what you gonna do?
Leave me here
don't come near
