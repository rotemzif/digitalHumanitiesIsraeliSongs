My laziness occurs 
Every day it burns 
Covers me and pulls me down 
Too lazy to protest 
Sneaks into my bed 
Caught me unprepared 
Once again it strikes me down 
Another day is Dead 
Just close the door when you go out 
Don’t let the light Reveal it all 
That I’m Wrapped inside my own 
And only want to be alone 
My laziness occurs 
Every day it burns 
Covers me and pulls me down 
Too lazy to protest
