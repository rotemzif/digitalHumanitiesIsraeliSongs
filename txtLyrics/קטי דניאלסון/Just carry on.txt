Its funny how things turned around
I was walking on air but I fell to the ground
The demons are pulling me down
They’re craving for meat 
as I race for the crown
And even though
I'm letting go
Just carry on girl just carry on
Believe in yourself and the troubles are gone
Just carry on girl just carry on
Accept all your fears 
and forget them by dawn
Everything seemed to be right
I was dreaming at day
and I flew through the night
The movie was playing, I cried
When I looked at the screen I felt I was blind
Illusions
and confusions
Just carry on girl just carry on
Believe in yourself and the troubles are gone
Just carry on girl just carry on
Accept all your fears 
and forget them by dawn
Reality check here I am
Waiting in line, it’s a broken heart game
Stop looking for someone to blame
The good times are here and they’re calling my name
