Take me.
As far as it can get
Beyond the bricks of regret
Please take me to that place again
Take me
where stiff becomes velvet
Our clothes are soak and wet
Please Take me to that place again.
That place we all know that.
Take me
I'l Train my mind to be
a loyal gentle pet.
Please take me to the endless road
of every silly step.
I swear to you my love
I do the best i can
I swear to you my love
After this hurricane..
Take me
Cause past left here its ashes
I feel my inside crashes
I don't wanna be led by fear
ill make this coast now clear
Clear me
Im Reaching out for life
Yet I don't want to be
A sacrifice, a Warrior
I just wanna be me
I swear to you my love
I do the best i can
I swear to you my love
After this hurricane ...
I swear to you my love
I do the best i can
I swear to you my love
After this hurricane ...
bless me
A kiss out of this -mess me
I'm dancing my soul out
I'm dancing my soul in
I'm glancing at the storm
Of the puberty were in.
I swear to you my love
I do the best i can
I swear to you my love
After this hurricane ...
