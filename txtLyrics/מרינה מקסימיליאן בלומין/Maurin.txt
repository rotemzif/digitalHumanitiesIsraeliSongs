I can only give you what you never needed
I've got it all
But it's all you'll never need
I'm surprised by myself
Of this love that filled me
But I cannot resist
Love I have to feed
Never noticed your lips
Never noticed that touch
Never noticed my eyes looking after you
I can only give you what you never needed
I've got it all
But it's all you'll never need
Swear to God that I try 
Not to push too hard
Too hard, it's too hard
Tell me
How much longer could I hide?
Never noticed your hair
Never noticed that smell
Never noticed my senses crawling after you
I can only give you what you never needed
I've got it all
But you got it all yourself
It's unbearably cold
To absorb your warmth
And to know
These arms
I can never hold
Never noticed your feet
Never notices that wrinkle
Never noticed my breath synchronizing yours
I can only give you what you never needed
