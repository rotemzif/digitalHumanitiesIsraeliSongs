Ray of sun in my eyes
My head lies between your thighs
Ray of spring time and goods
Nothing we can do 
When we get in these moods
We say:
 "I don't wanna know 'bout that",
"Whisper it to me" he said
Now the good days are here
Your eyes glow 
In spite of fear
Ray of air in my lunges
Nothing we can say 
When we miss a chance 
We say: 
"I don’t wanna know 'bout that",
"whisper it to me" he said
All I see 
All I feel
All I know
I do my best to let the flow
Lead me
All I hear
All I mean
All I show
I do my best to let the flow
Heal me
"whisper it to me" he said
Ray of blossoming trees
We look forward to the years
Ray of joy to my spine
How can I complain
When I know you're mine?
We say: 
" I don’t wanna know 'bout that", 
"whisper it to me" he said
All I see 
All I feel
All I know
I do my best to let the flow
Lead me
All I hear
All I mean
All I show
I do my best to let the flow
Feed me
All I see
All I feel 
All I know
I do my best 
To let the flow 
Heal me
"Whisper it to me" 
He said
