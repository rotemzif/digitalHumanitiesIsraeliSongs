I'm standing alone
In the middle of my process
Here I couldn't go wrong
When suddenly I notice
I've become so strong
That I even admit 
I could use somebody to love
I stood on my own
I deserve all the trophies
I deserted sorrow
And immediately I noticed
Passion came with joy
And I even admit 
I would love somebody to love 
Me
I realize the souls unite  
And ask us to go out and find ourselves a partner
I recognize and empathize with
The adventurous naive girl drowning in hard core
I trust this man mother
I trust his motivation
It seems like the end mother
It seems like the end of my searching
I feel he's a true lover
I think I'm accepting my new life of deep deep devotion.

Passion came with joy

I realize the souls unite
And ask us to go out and find ourselves a partner
I reminisce and empathize with
The adventurous naive girl drowning in hard core
I trust this man mother
I trust his motivation
It seems like the end mother
It seems like the end of my searching
I feel he's a true lover
