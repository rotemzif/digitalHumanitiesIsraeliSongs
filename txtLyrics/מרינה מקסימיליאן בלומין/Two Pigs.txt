I try to understand
Try to figure out
Try to realize
My heart felt second hand
And neglected
Like a compromise
I needed you so badly
That I hated you
I needed you
I wanted to reach you gladly
Got exhausted 
Trying to please you 
I needed you so badly 
That I hated you
I needed you
I wanted to reach you gladly
Got exhausted 
From protecting you
This hole was too big
Hungry like two pigs
I try to understand 
Try to figure out
Try to realize
My heart felt second hand
And neglected
Like a compromise
I needed you so badly 
That I hated you
I needed you
I wanted to reach you gladly
Got exhausted 
Trying to please you 
I needed you so badly 
That I hated you
I needed you
I wanted to reach you gladly
Got exhausted
From protecting you
This hole was too big
Hungry like two pigs
I try to understand
Try to figure out
Try to realize
Loads of packages
Few past passengers
Got themselves free rides
Hungry like two pigs
I try to understand 
Try to figure out
Try to realize
