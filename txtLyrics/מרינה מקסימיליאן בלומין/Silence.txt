Everyone's a sleep 
And I swear to keep 
My head under the blanket
Wait until you show
Show me everyday 
In a new familiar way
Now we're dancing in slow motion 
In the middle of the ocean
The princess under the bed
The dragon's over my head
The gremlins and the elves 
Are climbing down the shelves
While the mountain falls asleep
The tigers swore to keep
Their singing voices down
Until we touch the ground
Again
I see Horses diving
I see Lions whining
I see Seashells yawning 
I see 
I see 
I see Shadows Wandering 
I see Whiskers shiver
I see Noses seeking
I see 
I see
I see Monsters tickled
I see Turtles cuddle
I see Flowers gossip
I see
I see Teachers gambling
I see Homework drowning
I see Grandmas dancing
I see 
I see
I see Clumsy peacocks
I see Pianos sneezing
I see Crispy water
I see 
I see
Everyone's a sleep 
And I swear to keep
My head under the blanket
Wait until you show
Show me everyday 
In a new familiar way
Now we're dancing in slow motion 
In the middle of the ocean
