When the riot will calm down
When the fear will be vanished
When the master of hell
Will obey your commands 
It is then that you would realize 
This is the peace you were looking for
It is then that you would know
This is the peace you were dreaming of
Without motivation you're doomed to fail
The only force that leads you to victory is love
Power and arrogance meant the world to you
But now your seeking for other virtues 
It is then that you would announce 
This is the peace I was dreaming of
You're a king without a throne 
But the peace would always be within you
