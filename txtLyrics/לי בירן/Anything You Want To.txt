Anything you want to 
and everything you do 
anything you like 
it's possible, it's true 
I believe in magic 
just a simple smile 
waiting to appear 
and i believe in circumstance 
it's a sweet romance, i do 
Anything you want to 
and everything you do 
anything you like 
it's possible, it's true 
anything you want to 
and everything you say 
anything you love 
you can feel it in the air 
I believe in innocence 
self-confidence 
it's true 
and i believe in second chance 
in holding hands with you 
Anything you want to 
and everything you do 
anything you like 
it's possible, it's true 
anything you want to 
and everything you say 
anything you love 
you can feel it in the air 
And i know that that the world isn't perfect 
yes i know, but it's all right 
and i know that your heart will go stronger 
and to touch you and to touch you 
Anything you want to 
and everything you do 
anything you like 
it's possible, it's true 
anything you want to 
and everything you say 
anything you love 
you can feel it in the air 
Anything you want to 
and everything you do 
anything you like 
it's possible, it's true 
anything you want to 
and everything you say 
anything you love 
you can feel it in the air 
Anything you want to do 
it's possible, you know, it's true 
anything you want to see 
whenever you can fight your way 
anything you want to
