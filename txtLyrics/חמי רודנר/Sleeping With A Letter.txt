It's to easy to forgive 
That is why you have to leave 
Look at me I'm sleeping with a letter 
Instead of you 
Though the world is full with hate 
Our island was filled with faith 
Look at me I'm sleeping with a letter 
Instead of you 
I'm so hurt 'cause I love you so 
How can I be sure at all? 
When you say that we won't fall 
Look at me I'm sleeping with a letter 
Instead of you 
Go to sleep my little one 
Dream a dream of golden sun 
Look at me I'm sleeping with a letter 
Instead of you 
I'm so hurt 'cause I love you so
