To be alone one thing I know well 
Getting with the crowds on football days 
Though I know, It's no use at all 
It's just the same 
To be alone one thing I know well 
Walking down her street so I may say: 
"lovely day, lets go away" in case we meet 
To be alone is to join your local pub 
Don't you know my friend it's just no use at all 
To be alone one thing I know well 
Getting on a bus that takes me far, far away 
Could be anywhere I wouldn't mind 
To be alone is to join your local pub 
Don't you know my friend it's just no use at all 
To be alone is to wish your dreams come true... 
Always alone that's why I sing this song 
Don't you know my friend it's just no use at all.
