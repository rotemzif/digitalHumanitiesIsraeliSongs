Spitting lyrics like bullets
smashing, cracking, you're dead
since I was a girly - girl
I did it in my fucking head
cause i'm not that kind of person
only want to be lead
I'mma hit you with the beat
till your doubts are fucking dead
You see, I've been through so much
since I decided music's my life
and I tried to hold on to
to never give up what I knew
I spit what i wanna spit
I ain't never gave a shit
been through hell to get to where I am
ain't never gonna quit
This radio presenter
who said I'm just a banner
another pretty face
but there is nothing in her clamor
I never understood her thing
she's just another yammer
trying to tell us that she's different
but she's longing for the centre
like they all do
But he only made me wanna prove
him and all the others
that had thought that I just couldn't do
man fuck that! I always knew what I'm supposed to do
So relax, sit back, take your time while I'll be counting up the
CHING! CHI CHING CHING! CHI CHING CHING!
WORK IT WORK IT 
WORK IT WORK IT
WORK IT WORK IT
WORK IT WORK IT
I am the answer 
the question
and on top of all I am the passion
I do my shit, it's my imagination
that's all i think of
it's my main obsession
this is my fantasy
this is my tragedy
this is my fucked up lost reality
it's just part of my mentality
do not try to fight you gravity
This radio presenter
who said i'm just a banner
another pretty face
another pretty face
another pretty face
another pretty face
WORK IT WORK IT 
WORK IT WORK IT
WORK IT WORK IT
WORK IT WORK IT
Spitting lyrics
like it's a speech of a president
yeah this is my time, my moment
no one here to prevent
been working and working so hard to constantly invent
don't you try to take what's mine
for there's no one around that can
WORK IT WORK IT 
WORK IT WORK IT
WORK IT WORK IT
WORK IT WORK IT
