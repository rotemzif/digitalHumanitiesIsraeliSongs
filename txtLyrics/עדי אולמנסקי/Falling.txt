Things are getting lost at night
Memories are out of sight
And yet i wish you were by my side
Part of me know that you were right
I didn't get how hard you tried
But since you are gone my heart can't seem to be o.k
I... Can I heal without feeling time?
Can I heal without feeling grime?
Can i heal without feeling?
Falling...
I'm falling...
So many things i didn't do
Could only see it once we were through
Now i cannot sleep without you
I guess there is a part of you
In me no matter what I do
Oh god, what the hell? How could you let this go away?
I... Can I heal without feeling time?
Can I heal without feeling grime?
Can i heal without feeling?
Falling...
I'm falling...
Imma be stronger, Imma be stronger,
Imma be, Imma be, Imma be stronger,
Imma be, Imma be, Imma be
Imma be better, Imma be better,
Imma be, Imma be, Imma be better,
Imma be better, yeah
Falling...
I'm falling...
Falling...
I'm falling...
Imma be stronger, Imma be better
