Late in life 
You came to me 
And you put a sign 
On me 
Late in life... 
What remained of you 
When you fell into 
A trap of lies 
You, you, you - only you, you, you 
All your love 
That I love 
All your love 
Like a man 
Who plays the game 
As a healing 
For his pain 
You played your game 
Again and again 
Crazy - insane 
Deep in love
