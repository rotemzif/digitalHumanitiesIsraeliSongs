i see you on the street and you walk on by 
You make me wanna hang my head down and cry 
If you gave me half a chance you'd see 
My desire burning inside of me 
But you choose to look the other way 
I've had to work much harder than this 
For something I want don't try to resist me 
Open your heart to me 
I hold the lock and you hold the key 
Open your heart to me 
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key 
I think that you're afraid to look in my eyes 
You look a little sad boy, I wonder why 
I follow you around but you can't see 
Too wrapped up in yourself to notice 
So you choose to look the other way 
Don't try to run I can keep up with you 
Nothing can stop me from trying, you've got to 
Open your heart to me 
I hold the lock and you hold the key 
Open your heart to me 
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key 
Open your heart with the key 
One is such a lonely number 
Open your heart, I'll make you love me 
Open your heart with the key 
One is such a lonely number 
Open your heart with the key 
I'll make you love me 
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key 
Open your heart with the key 
One is such a lonely number 
Open your heart 
Open your heart with the key 
I'll make you love me 
I'll make you love me
