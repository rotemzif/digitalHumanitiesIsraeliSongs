SHADAY AMOR NO DAAY 
As I look back on yesteryear 
A picture's coming clear 
I see my father work the fields 
My mother holds me near 
I traveled far but now I'm here 
To sing for you my tears 
The yellow moon shines in my eyes 
And watches while I cry 
OH... OH... EL SHADAY 
OH... OH... EL SHADAY 
Tell me who am I 
Tell me who am I 
OH... EL SHADAY 
Many years and tears ago 
My people were scattered 
Taking with them broken souls 
From homes, where time once mattered 
My lonely land my lonely land 
Alone two thousand years 
And now returned our holy-land 
But fields are field with tears 
YA ROOHI YA YOOMA 
RAWINI FAIN BAITEAK 
YA ROOHI YA YOOMA 
RAWINI FAIN BAITEAK 
ANNA MADLOOME YA YOOMA 
BIEAD BIEAD MINIK 
ANNA MADLOOMA YA YOOMA 
BIEAD BIEAD MINIK 
YA YOOMA...
