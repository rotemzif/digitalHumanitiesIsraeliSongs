Only when you travel 
Very deep inside yourself 
Can you recognize the stranger 
You've become 
And suddenly you're standing 
On your own 
Far from home 
Far from home 
And when we're face to face 
Look in my eyes 
And when we're face to face 
Tell me no lies 
You know we need help 
Yeah, yeah, we do 
Yeah, we need help 
And I'm with you 
All of the way 
All of the way 
All of the way 
All of the way 
Only love can take a man 
And turn him inside out 
Time to turn the page and start 
A whole new story now 
Once again we're standing 
On our own 
With far to go 
With far to go 
And when we're face to face 
Look in my eyes 
And when we're face to face 
Tell me no lies 
You know we need help 
Yeah, yeah, we do 
Yeah, we need help 
And I'm with you 
All of the way
