Cry, oh baby, cry, oh baby, cry 
My brothers are still far away too far 
Thousand years of yearning in your sigh 
Cry, oh baby, cry for a sign 
My brothers are there 
Nobody cares 
Nobody cares 
If they are homeless 
My brothers are there 
Nobody cares 
Can't someone see 
How they need a homeland

Nobody cares 
No one should ever 
Be homeless 
My brothers are there 
Nobody cares 
Can't someone see 
How they need a homeland
