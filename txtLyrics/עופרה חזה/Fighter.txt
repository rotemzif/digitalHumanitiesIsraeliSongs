I've been hearing nasty rumors 
Every single place I go 
And you've been seen with her in public 
Did you think I wouldn't know? 
This time you have bitten off 
More than you can chew 
Watch out for me 
I'm gonna get you 
People tell me she's good looking 
I don't care if she's a star 
Someone's in my territory 
This affair has gone too far 
Never underestimate 
What this girl can do 
Watch out for me 
I'm gonna get you 
Fighter 
Don't mess around with a fighter 
And as the corner gets tighter 
I'm gonna fight for your love 
Fighter 
I'll get you back, I'm a fighter 
I'll never loose you despite her 
I'm gonna fight for your love 
She is in for lots of trouble 
I won't take this lying down 
You won't remember what she looks like 
When I win the final round 
She is just a one night stand 
But I'm in love with you 
So stick around 
Cause I'm coming through 
Fighter 
Don't mess around with a fighter 
And as the corner gets tighter 
I'm gonna fight for your love 
Fighter 
I'll get you back, I'm a fighter 
I'll never loose you despite her 
I'm gonna fight for your love 
Watch out for me 
I'm gonna get you 
Fighter 
I'll get you back, I'm a fighter 
I'll never loose you despite her 
I'm gonna fight for your love 
Fighter
