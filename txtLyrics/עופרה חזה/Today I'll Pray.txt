You told me we would always be together 
Oh, ANENI 
Now look where you are 
You're fighting, waging war for peace 
They took you far away from here 
You know there is one thing we can do 
we two can do today 
Today I'll pray 
for another day 
Today I'll pray 
for a day of love 
No another war 
No another war 
Like yesterday 
Today I'll pray 
HALYLA LACH ODE KOLI 
HALAYLA BETOCH NISHMATI 
ANENI 
HALAYLA ATA BETOCHI 
HALAYLA ITCHA TFILA 
You know there is one thing we can do 
we two can do today 
Io ci ho fede, 
Io ci ho speranza, 
Io ci ho amore, 
Io ci ho te, tu ci hai me, 
Noi abbiamo dei sogni 
Noi avremo 
Pace, finalmente, 
Libert◊ê, finalmente 
Gandhi, Doctor King, Ben-Gurion, 
I loro sogni vivranno un'altra volta. 
Today I'll pray 
for another day 
Today I'll pray 
for a day of love 
I have faith, I have hope, I have love 
I have you, you have me, 
we have dreams, 
we'll finally have peace, 
(we'll finally have) freedom 
Gandhi, King, Ben-Gurion, 
their dreams will live again. 
Today I'll pray 
for another day 
Today I'll pray 
for a day of love 
No another war 
No another war 
Like yesterday 
Today I'll pray 
Today I'll pray
