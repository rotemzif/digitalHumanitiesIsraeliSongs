Back in ancient time 
Loving was a crime 
For a single girl 
Like the beautiful 
DAW DA HIYA 
Sisters barred her way 
But she couldn't wait 
She spurned her father's hand 
And took her man

Her passion drove her wild

Her love was suicide 
Love comes with a price 
They came for her one night 
For her family's shame 
She had to face 
The judge's might 
Now she was with child 
No one was at her side 
When the judge declared that she must die

In a time and place 
Where a woman can't show her face 
Her life is ruled by man 
That shouldn't happen again
