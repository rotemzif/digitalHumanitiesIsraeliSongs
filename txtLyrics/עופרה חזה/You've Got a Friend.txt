I'll come running just to see you again 
When you're down and troubled 
And you need some loving care 
And nothing, nothing is going right 
Close your eyes and think of me 
And soon I will be there 
To bright up even your darkest night 
You just call out my name 
And you know wherever I am 
I'll come running to see you again 
Winter, spring, summer or fall 
All you have to do is call 
And I'll be there - yeah, yeah 
You've got a friend 
If the sky above you 
Grows dark and full of clouds 
And that old north wind 
Begins to blow 
Keep your had together 
And call my name out loud 
Soon you'll hear me 
Knocking at your door 
You just call out my name 
And you know wherever I am 
I'll come running just to see you again 
Winter, spring, summer or fall 
All you have to do is call 
And I'll be there 
Yes I will 
Now - ain't it good to know 
That you've got a friend 
When people can be so cold 
They'll hurt you and desert you 
And take your soul if you let them 
Oh, but donâ€™t you let them 
You just call out my name 
And you know wherever I am 
I'll come running, running to see you again 
Winter, spring, summer or fall 
All you have to do is call 
And I'll be there 
Yes I will 
To see you again 
You've got a friend
