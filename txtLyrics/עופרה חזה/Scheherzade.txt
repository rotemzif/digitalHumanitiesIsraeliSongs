Fear was in her eyes 
A thousand and one nights 
Fear was in her eyes 
Just to stay alive 
She will never never come back 
Oh, I want to see her one day 
She will never never come back 
Oh, I want to see her one day 
Night after night, 
A thousand nights 
Scheherzade 
Oh what a night, 
A thousand nights 
Scheherzade 
She cast a spell on him now 
Oh, his love for her was tender 
Love can be so suicidal 
Oh, I want to see her one day 
She will never never come back 
Oh, I want to see her one day 
She will never never come back 
Oh, I want to see her one day 
Night after night, 
A thousand nights 
Scheherzade 
Oh what a night, 
A thousand nights 
Scheherzade
