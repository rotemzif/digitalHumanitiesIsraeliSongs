The desert wind 
From the east 
Binding us together 
Dance for me Taw Shi 
The day has come to prove 
To prove your love forever 
Oh... oh... 
Dance for me Taw Shi 
Among the two 
I prefer you 
I want to see you 
Set fire to the night 
Among the two 
You must come through 
Oh... let me see you 
Set fire to the night 
Oh... oh... 
Dance for me this dance 
Oh... oh... 
Chant with me this chant 
So follow me 
Across the sand 
To where the music's playing 
Oh... oh... 
Dance for me Taw Shi 
The sounds will blow 
A thousand years 
The rhythm still remains 
Oh... oh... 
Dance for me Taw Shi 
Among the two 
I prefer you 
I want to see you 
Set fire too the night 
Among the two 
You must come through 
Oh... let me see you 
Set fire to the night 
Oh... oh... 
Dance for me this dance 
Oh... oh... 
Chant with me this chant 
Oh... oh... yeah... yeah... 
Taw Shi GAD SA DAR 
Oh... oh... yeah... yeah... 
Taw Shi WA NA DAR 
i want to see you 
Set fire to the sky
