In this burning town, 
Love is a shelter any time. 
When times of madness come 
Times of fire and hate 
Come over now, 
Touch my hand 
And feel the love again 
Come over now, 
Touch my hand 
And feel the love again 
Don't cry, give me power now 
Don't cry, give me power now 
When times of madness come 
Times of fire and hate 
Come over now, 
Touch my hand 
And feel the love again 
Come over now, 
Touch my hand 
And feel the love again 
Da'ale, Da'ale 
Da'ale, Da'ale 
Da'ale, Da'ale 
Da'ale, Da'ale 
Da'ale, Da'ale
