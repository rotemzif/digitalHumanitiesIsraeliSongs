In the temple of love you hide together 
Believing pain and fear outside 
But someone near you rides the weather 
And the tears he cried will rain on walls 
As wide as lovers eyes 
In the temple of love - Shine like thunder 
In the temple of love - Cry like rain 
In the temple of love - Hear my calling 
In the temple of love - Hear my name 
With the sunlight died and night above me 
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain inside 
You run for cover in the temple of love 
You run for another it's all the same 
For the wind will blow and throw your walls aside 
With the fire from the fireworks up above 
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain 
You run for cover in the temple of love 
I shine like thunder cry like rain 
And the temple grows old and strong 
But the wind blows longer cold and long 
And the temple of love will fall before 
This black wind calls my name to you no more 
In the black sky thunder sweeping 
Underground and over water 
Sounds of crying weeping will not save 
Your faith for bricks and dreams for mortar 
All your prayers must seem as nothing 
Ninety-six below the wave 
When stone is dust and only air remains 
In the temple of love - shine like thunder 
In the temple of love - cry like rain 
In the temple of love - hear the calling 
In the temple of love - is falling 
Down 
Temple of love 
In the temple of love - shine like thunder 
In the temple of love - hear my name 
In the temple of love you hide together 
Believing pain and fear outside 
But someone near you rides the weather 
And the tears he cried will rain on walls 
As wide as lovers eyes 
In the temple of love - Shine like thunder 
In the temple of love - Cry like rain 
In the temple of love - Hear the calling 
In the temple of love - is falling down
