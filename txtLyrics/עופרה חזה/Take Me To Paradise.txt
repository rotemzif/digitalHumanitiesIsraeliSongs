Outlined silhouettes, dancing in the dark 
Caught inside your web, you stole my heart 
Knew it was wrong from the start 
You sole my heart 
Knew it was wrong from the start 
This game is suicide 
I told you once before 
I feel victimised 
'cause I want you more 
How can I say goodbye? 
Tonight, tonight 
Running away from you 
Running away from you for ever 
We live in fantasy we're living in tragedy 
But take me to paradise, take me to paradise 
Take me to heaven, make me forget 
That you'll never be mine 
Secret rendez-vous 
Dreams that won't come true 
Everything I want 
I found in you 
How can I live this lie? 
Tonight, tonight 
Running away from you 
Running away from you forever 
We live in fantasy we're living in tragedy 
But take me to paradise, take me to paradise 
Take me to heaven, make me forget 
That you'll never be mine 
Take me to paradise 
We live in fantasy we're living in tragedy 
But take me to paradise, take me to paradise 
Take me to heaven 
Oh... 
Take me to paradise, oh paradise 
Oh... take me to paradise
