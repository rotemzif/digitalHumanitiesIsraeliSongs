Can't you see in this time of fear 
People are hiding there tears 
In this time we need someone to hear 
Someone to fear 
I hope you see 
The same as I see 
I hope you see 
Like I do 
I hope you see 
As far as I see 
I hope you see 
Like I do 
No time to hate 
As you know - wild is the wind 
So wild is all our life 
No time to hate - only to love 
Please hold me tight 
I hope you see 
The same as I see 
I hope you see 
Like I do 
I hope you see 
As far as I see 
I hope you see 
Like I do 
No time to hate 
I hope you see 
The same as I see 
I hope you see 
Like I do 
I hope you see 
As far as I see 
I hope you see 
Like I do 
I hope you see 
The same as I see 
I hope you see 
Like I do 
I hope you see 
As far as I see 
I hope you see 
Like I do 
No time to hate 
No time to hate
