Don’t change your heart 
I’m still a part of what we started 
many years ago 
Please don’t despair 
we’re still a pair 
so let’s prepare 
for better days to grow 
You mustn’t grieve 
I do believe 
that the hope inside will never die 
We do belong 
we must be strong 
and like a song 
we’ll spread our wings and fly 
You mustn’t grieve 
I do believe 
that the hope inside will never die 
High, high, high 
gonna take you high 
Higher than the skyline 
higher than the sunshine 
aiming for a dream together 
High, high, high 
heading for the sky 
Over hills and meadows 
like a golden arrow 
like a magic beam 
You can’t deny (High, high) 
that you and I (High, high) 
Once knew a time 
of happiness and bliss 
Don’t say goodbye (High, high) 
before we try (High, high) 
Again to find the loving that we missed 
You mustn’t grieve 
I do believe 
that the hope inside will never die 
High, high, high 
gonna take you high 
Higher than the skyline 
higher than the sunshine 
aiming for a dream together 
High, high, high 
heading for the sky 
Over hills and meadows 
like a golden arrow 
like a magic beam 
Don’t change your heart 
I’m still a part 
of what we started many years ago 
Please don’t despair 
we’re still a pair 
so let’s prepare for better days to grow 
You mustn’t grieve (Mustn’t grieve) 
I do believe (Do believe) 
that the hope inside will never die 
High, high, high 
gonna take you high 
Higher than the skyline 
higher than the sunshine 
aiming for a dream together 
High, high, high 
heading for the sky 
Over hills and meadows 
like a golden arrow 
like a magic beam 
High, high, high, 
so very high, high, high
