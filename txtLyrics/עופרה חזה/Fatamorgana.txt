Fire in the sky 
Colors flying through her mind 
Desert touch the sky 
Here at the place where she will die 
She is looking far far away 
It seems there's no escape 
From a prison without bars 
Only to follow the bright star 
She's running all of the way 
FATAMORGANA 
Only, only yesterday 
FATAMORGANA 
A little girl a little girl 
Longing for her mother's world 
She was just a little girl 
FATAMORGANA 
YOO MA YA YOO MA 
MIN DA LAM NIK 
MIN DA LAM 
YOO MA YA YOO MA 
MIN DA LAM NIK 
MIN DA LAM 
KOOL HA YA TIK 
YA AH YA 
HO MI YO 
Ho mirage 
She's running all of the way 
FATAMORGANA 
Only, only yesterday 
FATAMORGANA 
A little girl a little girl 
Longing for her mother's world 
She was just a little girl 
FATAMORGANA 
A little girl a little girl 
Longing for her mother's world 
I was just a little girl 
FATAMORGANA 
FATANORGANA 
Mama 
Ah... ah... ah... ah... 
Ah... ah... mirage
