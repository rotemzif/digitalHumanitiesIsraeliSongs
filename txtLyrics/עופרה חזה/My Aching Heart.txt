I thought by now I'd forget 
Give me a sign 
I wanted more than the pain you left 
It's here all the time 
You're so out of reach' a disappearing star 
And still, when you look at me 
You tear me apart 
Tear me apart 
When you flow through me 
Surround me and light the dark 
Brand me and leave your mark 
My aching heart 
When you flow through me 
Surround me and light the dark 
Brand me and leave your mark 
My aching heart 
Is breaking again 
We've turned the page, and the summer's gone 
Turning to fall 
Memories paint the pictures like dreams 
I hear you call 
Was it only a dream when you made love to me 
And you filled my soul 
Made me whole 
And watched me cry 
My aching heart 
When you flow through me 
Surround me and light the dark 
Brand me and leave your mark 
My aching heart 
When you flow through me 
Surround me and light the dark 
Brand me and leave your mark 
My aching heart 
Is breaking again 
And floating somewhere 
You're there between pain and tears 
Between my love and fear 
Where no-one hears 
And I've got nothing 
No strength left to watch you fall 
Nothing left at all 
When you flow through me 
Surround me and light the dark 
Brand me and leave your mark 
My aching heart
