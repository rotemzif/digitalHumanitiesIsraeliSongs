In my Promised Land 
In the Middle East 
What can we do about 
Terrorism? 
In my promised land 
In the middle east 
What can we do about 
Fanaticism? 
You and I on parallel lines 
You and I, we are the key 
Dreams are not enough 
To lead and guide us 
To peace 
In the Middle East 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh 
In the Middle East 
Oh oh oh oh 
Desire for peace 
Such yearning for peace 
Does your country do 
What you believe in? 
In my land there is war 
And we're losing our soul 
And ideology is 
Losing meaning 
You and I on parallel lines 
You and I, when can we meet? 
Dreams are not enough 
To lead and guide us 
To peace 
In the Middle East 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh 
In the Middle East 
Oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh

In the Middle East 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Flare lights, flowers, mothers, fathers 
Home land, green fields and tears 
Borders, river, desert, dead sea 
We are the key 
Flare lights, flowers, mothers, fathers 
Home land, green fields and tears 
Borders, river, desert, dead sea 
When can we meet?
