Oh let the sun beat down upon my face 
Stars to fill my dream 
I am a traveler of both time and space 
To be where I have been 
As the dust that floats high in June 
When movin' through Kashmir. 
With no provision but an open face 
Along the straits of fear 
I been flying 
There ain't no denyin' 
Flying, flying 
All I see turns to brown 
All I see turns to brown 
As the sun burns the ground 
Burns, burns 
And my eyes fill with sand 
My eyes fill with sand 
As I scan this wasted land 
This wasted land 
Trying to find 
Trying to find 
Trying to find 
Trying to find where I've been 
Trying to find 
Trying to find 
Trying to find 
Trying to find 
Trying to find where I've been 
Trying to find 
Trying to find 
Trying to find 
Trying 
Try 
well I'm down 
So down...
