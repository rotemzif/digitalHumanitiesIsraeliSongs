All my life I'm waiting for you 
Mystery, fate and love 
To pray for you... but you... MERAHEF 
Far away... NEELAM 
Ho... mystery, fate and love 
Ho... mystery, fate and love 
Ho... my lord, my lord give me a chance 
Give me a hand to hold on to 
Give me a chance, give me a hand 
To hold on to 
Ho... mystery, fate and love 
Ho... mystery, fate and love 
All alone all alone 
BEEMOONA OOBITFILA TEFILA ho... ho... 
But you MERAHEF far away NEELAM 
Ho... mystery, fate and love 
Ho... mystery, fate and love 
Ho... my lord, my lord give me a chance 
Give me a hand to hold on to 
Give me a chance, give me a hand 
To hold on to 
Ho... mystery, fate and love 
Ho... mystery, fate and love 
ASHAYA... SHAYA... AYA
