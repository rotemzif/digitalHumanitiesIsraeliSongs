Black and white, 
Male, female, 
For life and love 
Sometimes, when I fly 
So high 
Slowly in the sky 
NOTE SHAMAYIM KAYERI'AH 
HAMEKARE BAMAYIM ALIYOTAV 
HASAM AVIM REHUVO 
HAMEHALEH AL KANFEY RU'AH 
For life and love 
For life and love 
For life and love 
Floating as I find 
My dreams aid me for the light 
In the beginning 
God created the Heaven 
And the Earth and the light and the dark 
Black and white, 
Male, female, 
For life and love 
God created man 
In his own image 
In the image of God He created us 
Black and white, 
Male and female, 
For life and love 
For life and love 
For life and love 
Sometimes, when I fly 
So high 
slowly in the sky 
Floating as I find 
My dreams aid me for the light
