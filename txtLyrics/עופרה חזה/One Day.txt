This is a tragic past love 
I've been there once before 
This is a tragic past love 
Which is hunting me more and more 
HEYA HEYA HEYA HEYA 
HEYA HEYA HEYA HEYA 
DA ET YA MAL YA MAL 
DA ET YA MAL YA MAL 
DA ET YA MAL YA MAL 
MA GA WAB NI LA MALI 
MA GA WAB NI LA MALI 
One one day 
One one day 
You cast a spell on me once again 
And again and again... 
HEYA HEYA HEYA HEYA 
HEYA HEYA HEYA HEYA 
Fear was your eyes 
We had more than love 
I was in your life 
You couldnâ€™t change your mind 
Oh... we had more than love 
One one day 
One one day 
I want to see you 
One day... one day...
