What is it that you want from me? 
I really wish I knew 
I tried so hard to do my best 
But it's no good enough for you 
Over and over again 
We will make the same mistakes 
Over and over again 
There's a feeling I just can't change 
Is it time to go 
Our separate ways? 
Is it time to go 
Our separate ways? 
You know I need your love so bad 
Can't you see what you do to me? 
I tried so hard to understand 
But the truth is never plain to see 
Is it time to go 
Our separate ways? 
Is it time to go 
Our separate ways? 
Over and over again 
We will make the same mistakes 
Over and over again 
There's a feeling I just can't change 
Change, change 
Is it time to go 
Our separate ways? 
Is it time to go 
Our separate ways? 
Is it time to go 
Our separate ways? 
Is it time to go 
Our separate ways?
