I had a Paint Box 
Each color glowing with delight 
I had a Paint Box with colors 
Warm & cool & bright 
I had no red 
I had no red for wounds & blood 
I had no black for an orphaned child 
I had no white 
I had no white for the face of the dead 
I had no yellow for burning sands 
I had a Paint Box 
Each color glowing with delight 
I had a Paint Box with colors 
Warm & cool & bright 
I had orange 
I had orange for joy & life 
I had green for buds & blooms 
I had blue 
I had blue for clear bright skies 
I had pink for dreams & rest 
I had a Paint Box 
Each color glowing with delight 
I had a Paint Box with colors 
Warm & cool & bright 
I had a Paint Box 
Each color glowing with delight 
I sat down 
I sat down & painted peace 
Salom 
Shalom 
Shalom
