So many dreams 
And more I gave you 
'cause I knew that you are the one 
So many dreams 
And more I gave you 
I believed in you - my only one 
Amore, all that I need is you 
Amore, all that I need is you 
Haaaaaaaa 
Haaaaaaaa 
Haaaaaaaa 
Haaaaaaaa 
So many times for you I waited 
Now I want to force 
The dreams to stay 
So many hopes 
And more were realized 
I can't wait to make 
The dream come true 
Amore, all that I need is you 
Amore, all that I need is you 
Amore, all that I need is you
