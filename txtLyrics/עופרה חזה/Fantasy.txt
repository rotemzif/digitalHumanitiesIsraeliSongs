Fly trip fall 
Scale the wall 
Take a stroll 
Catch your fantasy 
Jump skip sail 
Pay your bail 
Stop the race 
Catch your fantasy 
There's a prison in the making on the border your mind 
Fantasies can run like smugglers 
Catch them 
One at the time 
Break out roll 
Stoke the coals 
Dream my dreams 
Catch your fantasy 
Sound the beat 
Leave your feet 
Choose a world 
Match your fantasy 
There's a new world for the taking at the order of your mind 
Fantasies are horror movies 
Watch them 
One at the time 
There's a new world for the taking at the order of your mind

Choose a world

There's a prison in the making on the border your mind 
Fantasies are moving targets 
Shoot them one at the time 
There's a prison in the making on the border your mind 
Break out 
One at the time 
One at the time 
One at the time 
One at the time 
One at the time
