I can make you down from what you thought you said 
You can grab my hand and find your way ahead 
Storming over down in what you said 
Cause its bad and its sad and its making me mad and you go... 
Its making me there 
Its making everywhere 
Making a song heartbreaking 
Down i'm shaking 
To you there 
Here comes the new sun to my heart 
He's gonna breaking me a part 
He's gonna turn my mind around 
And I am satisfied! 
Its making me there 
Its making everywhere 
It makes me a song heartbreaking 
Down i'm shaking 
To you there 
Here comes the new sun
