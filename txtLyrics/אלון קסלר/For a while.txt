Something's missing and I don't know what 
Instead of kissing you going away from me 
And the sky is full of nothing 
And the smell of it is never good enough 
And if you crying 
Inside your head 
No one can here you 
No one instead me, 
I can wait for a while 'till you come back 
Me, I can wait for a while 
For a while 
And there's no return from what I've done 
I can still walk and play like everyone 
And the skies are full of shame 
And you will never return 
And if you crying 
Inside your head 
No one can here you 
No one instead me, 
I can wait for a while 'till you come back 
Me, I can wait for a while 
For a while 
Please don't go away from me 
It's fine with me 
You can stay with me 
And if you crying 
Inside your head 
No one can here you 
No one instead me, 
I can wait for a while 'till you come back 
Me, I can wait for a while 
For a while
