Every time I hold you
I begin to understand
All my troubles fade away
When you whispering my name.
I can see outside that the skies are blue,
Inside they're always gray,
You say baby well just maybe,
You will touch the sky today.
There's a time
Time that runs so fast
Never meant to last,
Passes you like a fly,
There's a time to make a dream come true,
It's only up to you,
It's only in your mind.
Just sing it la la la la la
When you find yourself in shambles,
Shadows loom along the way
Keep on dreaming, there is a tomorrow
Never hush or rush today.
Dive into the moment,
Leaving all the pits behind,
Climb on every single mountain,
Feel desires riding time
Just sing it la la la la la
You should always be yourself
Peel your heart from lies,
Keep the fate for fate
Never die inside
Just sing it la la la la la
