Somewhere she’s lost in forever of searching 
She has wings that 
she hid from the rain and the sun 
On the path she created 
She was waiting…… 
In a black dress she’s dancing 
To the sound of her mind 
She can feel 
the sand kissing her feet goodbye 
It’s time to breathe, it’s time to feel, 
the freshness of her life 
Somewhere she knows she’ll forever be searching 
She has wings that she hid from the rain and the sun 
On the path she created 
She is waiting …
