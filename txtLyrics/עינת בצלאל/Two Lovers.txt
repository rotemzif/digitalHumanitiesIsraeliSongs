Sometimes, I really think that life without you 
Has shown me the way 
I tried, to displace my selfish wishes of being myself 
Oh, I still insist to disregard my flame 
You pushed aside my sacred growing, 
Killing my dreams while I was helping yours 
To come out loud and prove to all how much 
you… 
Painted my life with blinding colors 
Ruining my soul with empty lies 
But now, I think I’ve found my guiding angel 
My profit is my sin 
I know 
that my journey’s long, never for nothing 
I have the trust in me 
I’m trying, 
to displace the selfish anger in me 
You irrigate my sacred growing 
Supporting my dreams while I am helping yours 
To come out loud and 
prove to all how much you… 
Painting my life with shiny colors 
Filling my soul with my desires. 
More than anything in this life 
The clearest thing for me is love 
And still I search for more… 
You irrigate my sacred growing...
