This is how we share things – we rather take 
This is how we find solutions – we love to brake  
This is how we give to each other - "what can I get instead?" 
 And this is how we blame one another - we rather hate  
 We haveone world  
But we're tearing-up nature  
We have one god  But still we're 
killing in the name of 
We have one soul  
Do you think you're different?  
We have one blood 
 But we think we're better than the other 
This is how we're living - we're suspicious  
This is how we treat exceptions – it's easier to reject them 
 This is how we educate - we tell them "not to"  And 
this is how we get respect - we make'em fear us 
   We have one world ... 
We have one world  
Can we see the beauty? 
 We have one god  
But we forget to thank him  
We have one soul  
We all have the same wishes  
We have one blood , 
tell me, Is the color different? 
   We have one world ...
