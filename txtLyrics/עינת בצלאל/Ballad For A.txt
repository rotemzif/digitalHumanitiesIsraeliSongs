You built yourself from dust 
You worked so hard 
But always kept your secret smile for me 
Just to make sure that I’m aware 
You built yourself from stars 
And all the time 
You knew perfectly where 
you were going to 
People followed your shine 
And now you’re on the top 
The whole world would collapse without you 
You’d better sell the precious time 
We saved for being together 
And now when I’m down 
I’m longing for your smile I’ve lost 
I’m reaching for your hands 
And I have nothing to grasp 
For every lie that you dare say 
To make me stay 
I swear to God I love you 
For every time you make my heart forget 
And I regret 
I swear to God I hate you one more time. 
We built our love on 
Hopes and tears and trust 
But still I knew I had to fight 
To save my existence in your mind 
I free-fell Without being held 
Into another phase 
Then I couldn’t resist Your hurting face 
For every lie that you dare say... 
And now you ignore 
The endless space I was for you 
You better kick me out of here 
If you can’t hold me forever 
And now I feel bad 
For all the freedom that I took 
For all the smiles that I replyed 
Without your consent 
And let me tell you one more thing – 
I've never sinned 
and never broke my loyalty to you
