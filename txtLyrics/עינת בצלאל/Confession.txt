Dear love, 
There’s something that I’ve kept inside for so long 
You’re so fine, 
I’ve loved you since that first dance at the party 
And your eyes, 
Your eyes can make me so much lighter… 
And everything is good 
Everything is beautiful 
Your family adores me, but 
I don’t feel the passion anymore 
Dear love, 
I remember that we thought about moving in together 
I cried, 
I don’t know whether I was glad or maybe sad 
And everyone, 
That looked at us said what a beautiful couple 
And everything is fine 
Everything is wonderful 
But I know deep inside me that, 
I can’t find my children’s eyes in yours… 
Going down 
I feel that my heart’s crawling 
On the ground 
I may not be the one who’s 
always strong To keep our love 
alive... 
Dear love, 
Remember the day that I came home confused 
I said, That nothing is on my mind 
But it wasn’t true 
That day, I met a boy that 
changed my world 
And everything is wrong 
Everything is upside down 
I’m in love with another but, 
I try hard not to loose my mind 
Going down ..
