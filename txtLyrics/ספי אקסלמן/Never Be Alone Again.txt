Too many phases around you,
Life makes you tired and weary.
You seek for a path with your name on the side,
Reaching a way concerned but full of pride,
Sometimes you lead as you make it,
When life reveals its ride.
So run stay clever, to the place where you'll be found,
We'll scream together, and try to push away the loss of time,
You will never be alone again.
Too many meanings you claim to find,
Defining but fading the same time.
Emancipation won't knock on your door,
Afraid of the moment when you'll return to this world,
But nowhere ashore.
So run...
You seek for a path with your name on the side,
Reaching a way concerned but full of pride,
If you ain't there for yourself,
Who else will be? who else will see?
So run..
