Singin' a song till the night is dawn,
Happy moments gather around and sing.
I got a feeling I got a clue,
Listened to the story told by the few, and sing.
Singin a song till the night is dawn,
Movin' to the rythm till I can no more, and sing.
I got away from it all and crossed the arrogant wall,
Step by step, tried not to fall, and sing
