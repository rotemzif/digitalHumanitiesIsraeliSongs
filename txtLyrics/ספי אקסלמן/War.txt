War under my knees,
And I'm praying lord for a cool breeze.
War under my knees,
Don't see the end of it,
Wont you please?
Echoes of fear all around,
There's a warning sound.
Lift up your gear away from the ground,
Here comes another round.
Drop your identity for a while,
No need for a smile,
Thought I lived for a cause and there I was,
Obeying orders from above.
War..
No sign of peace no sign of dove,
Nothing to be proud of.
Dear don't you worry for me,
And continue to be the one I'll truly love.
