Day's Passing by as I walk on free,
To the journey of might, to the journey of understanding.
Another meaning for a thrill sent away to fulfill,
the emptyness, because I've been asking for a change.
If I mind, will you surrender? and say the day's so bright?
Make me rise, make you believe, salvation is soon to come.
Hope is not to give up, feed it to the weak,
To the worried minds, and make this life woth living.
Fairwell the past, don't go to fast,
Leave a mark, leave a task, Because I've been asking for a change.
If I mind, will you surrender? and say the day's so bright?
Make me rise, make you believe, salvation is soon to come.
Come on make me rise (make me right) and make you believe,
Come on make me rise (make me right) and make you believe.
If...
