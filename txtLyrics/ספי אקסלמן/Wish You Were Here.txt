More than I breath, I think about you
Showing to me your ways of life.
More than I needed you kept on giving,
But I was a fool with emotions off.
And I wish you were here, and I wish you would come,
Because I'll conquer your fear,
When I'll be given a chance, any day.
Efforts were made more than I ever knew,
And claimed to be ahead of the way.
Fed me forbidden fruits of heaven,
Yet I was a fool that you couldn't sway.
And I wish you were here, and I wish you would come,
Because I'll conquer your fear,
When I'll be given a chance, any day.
