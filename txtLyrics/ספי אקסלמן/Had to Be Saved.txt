They came to solution when you drowned
Responsibility's heavy so it went and went around.
Asked how long the pain will last,
Oh memory was a cruel fate, that left marks from the past.
Who will step and take the blame?
Who will say that you had to be saved?
Who will step and take the blame?
You have an opinion of your own,
Pretend to be one of them,
Because the thought of being alone...
Waited a while now for a spark,
Lit up the last match and went into the dark.
