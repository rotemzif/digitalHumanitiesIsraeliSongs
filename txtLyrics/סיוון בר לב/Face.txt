Three AM
I'm looking right at your face
You're looking at the clock
The ticking it won't stop
And all I can think about
Is getting up
Chorus
It's been nice
But I don't wanna see you face in the morning
Don't wanna see you face in the morning
Let me be the man
This time
Four O'clock
I'm looking at the same spot
You're looking at the floor
Got nothin' to say no more
And all I can think about
Is gettin' up
Chorus
Looking at the exit can't say goodbye
I gotta run run run
