Separated here we stand Strangers in a foreign land, 
Trying to find out if we're really real. 
Two islands in the sea, Waiting for eternity, 
Taking what we beg, borrow, or steal. 
You don't know how I feel, You don't know how I feel, 
In the morning, WHEN YOU'RE GONE. 
Wonder why I look at you, there's nothing more that I can do, 
When faces stare at us all through the day. 
Try to tell you of my dreams, and life is much more than it seems, 
And I mean every single word I say. 
You don't know how I cry, You don't know how I try, 
To be with you, WHEN YOU'RE GONE. 
You don't know what it means, You don't know what it means, 
To be with you, WHEN YOU'RE GONE. 
You don't know how I try, You don't know how I try, You don't know how I try...
