If I were a boy 
Even just for a day 
I'd roll out of bed in the morning 
And throw on what I wanted and go 
Drink beer with the guys 
And chase after girls 
I'd kick it with who I wanted 
And I'd never get confronted for it 
Because they'd stick up for me 
If I were a boy 
I think that I'd understand 
how it feels to love a girl 
I swear I'd be a better man 
I'd listen to her 
cause I know how it hurts 
when you loose the one you wanted 
cause he's taken you for granted 
and everything you had got destroyed
It's a little too late for you to come back 
Say its just a mistake 
Think I forgive you like that 
If you thought I would wait for you 
You thought wrong 
But your just a boy 
You don't understand 
How it feels to love a girl 
Someday you'll wish you were a better man 
And everything that you had got destro   
If I were a boy 
I think that I'd understand 
how it feels to love a girl 
I swear I'd be a better man 
I'd listen to her 
cause I know how it hurts 
when you loose the one you wanted 
cause he's taken you for granted 
and everything you had got destroyed
