Time, time, don’t let me down,
You’re the man in my playground.
What you say, I will obey
Night and day.
Feel free to turn me on,
Feel free to change my song,
I will start and you’ll go on
Sing my song.
I say…
Chorus:
Zman-man
Ten li rak siman-man
Ten li et hazman
Lama lokhets alay
Tishan
You don’t know what you talk about
Zman man
Lama lo tishan-shan
Tagid li kama zman
Lama lihiyot shakhor,lavan
Time, time, don’t you be mine,
I will feed his songs and wine.
I’ll make you lazy, I’ll make you late.
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Wait, wait, we two are one,
But you always take the lead.
I lay down and you just run,
Minds your sweep.
I say…
Chorus
You don’t know what you talk about
Zman man
Lama lo tishan-shan
Tagid li kama zman
Lama lihiyot shakhor, lavan.
You don’t know what you talk about
Chorus
I say…
