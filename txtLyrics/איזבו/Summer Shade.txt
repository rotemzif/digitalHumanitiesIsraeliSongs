Summer summer shade, take a piece of my day
soon the hit will fade,when it's night we can play
summer shade
Summer summer shade,take good care of my eyes 
loosing tons of sweat, think I'm losing my mind
Summer shade
if the sky will cry for me
morning drops of rain on me
i will be OK today 
you'll see
Summer Summer shade
Summer summer shade,take a sit where i stand
tired got to sleep , can no longer pretend
Summer shade
if the trees will rise for me
giant leaves will wave for me
any price you say, I'll pay, feel free
Summer Summer shade
