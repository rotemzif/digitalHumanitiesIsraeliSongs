Durling if i'm sing a song i fall 
and the grasses green 
and your ride saring 
and the wear is white 
shuturing your treasure and the light

and if my baby cat

flowoe I dress I down 
I will standing there 
I will have nice hair 
and if you let me stay

when the land of down 
do the happiness play 
and if your mother shut 
wendy show me how to say good bay 
cause no madder what
