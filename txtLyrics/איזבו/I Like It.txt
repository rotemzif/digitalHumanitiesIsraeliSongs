You don't know what you like
You don't like what you've got
But what you've got i think it's Hot
Your mustard is my gold
Your Poison is my wine
So please don't lose-what I might use - like that
I like it I like it
Pour out your garbage can
And be my garbage friend
I show you some you'll show me some
Broken dead or now
just leave it here like that
Cause I can blow- and make it flow - like that
I like it I like it
I like it I like it
I like it
Why I don't why
Tell me why you like it
I like it like you don't know how
