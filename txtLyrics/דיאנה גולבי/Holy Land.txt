Why is everybody gone?
It's so quiet I can hear myself thinking
Where is everybody gone?
The world is ending, and I guess I was sleeping. 
Why is everything burning 
The roads the trees it's all burning
But why is everybody gone?
The world is ending, and I guess I was sleeping,
My holy land. 
Where is this big old man, 
With power in his hands and eyes..
I guess he's resting now, because we keep calling him, and calling him all night. 
My holy land. 
Saw some boys carrying freedom 
At least they thought so when they left. 
But why is everybody gone? 
It's so clear now 
I can hear the weapons roar, 
In my holy land.
