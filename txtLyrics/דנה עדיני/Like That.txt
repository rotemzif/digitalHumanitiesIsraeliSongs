I just wanted to say I am sorry 
I cannot go through one more day like this 
Each day getting harder I am worried 
I am not me 
I just wanted to say I am sorry 
I could have done things different 
But I am not that kind of girl 
Who stay in the same place 
Stay numb 
And who are you 
Making me confused 
The only thing I could change in my life fade out 
Like that 
I just wanted to say I am sorry 
I cannot go through one more day like this 
Each day getting harder I am worried 
I am not me 
I just wanted to say I am sorry 
I guess I didn't try to be strong enough 
But I never thought I'll be your boring little wife 
And who are you...
