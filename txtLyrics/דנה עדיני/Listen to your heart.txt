It's so hard for me to go to sleep
I can't find the right position..
I'm used to getting used to hear you breath,
Listen to your Heart...
And how can it be?
that you don't love me?
I never thought it wasn't meant to be...
and it's so hard for me to go to sleep
I can't find the right position..
I'm used to getting used to hear you breath,
Listen to your Heart...
