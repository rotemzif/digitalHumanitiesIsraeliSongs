I can't stand you 
As much as I love you so 
You've hurt the most precious place 
And I don't know if I'll ever 
Coming back to you 
Faces don't make any difference for me 
I can see you all like me as one 
And if you don't like 
What you see any more 
You can get out of here and go find 
you're a beautiful girl who would admire your body 
Adore you from head to you toes 
I don't have any strenght to go after your precious time 
I'm getting tired of sitting here crying for you 
And before I close the gate 
I've got to save me from myself 
'Couse I've been to the most ugly way 
And you never pull me put out 
ahh... 
Faces don't make any difference for me 
I can see you all like me as one 
And if you don't like 
What you see any more 
You can get out of here and go find 
you're a beautiful girl who would admire your body 
Adore you from head to you toes 
I don't have any strenght to go after your precious time 
I'm getting tired of sitting here crying for you 
Don't leave me yet, I still got many things to say
