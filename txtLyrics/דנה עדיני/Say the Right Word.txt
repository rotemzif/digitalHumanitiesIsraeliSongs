Say the right word one more time 
I honestly don't know if you are 
Lying just to make me feel good 
I don't know by now 
What has become of you 
The secrets in your heart 
The love you had for me 
Will stay the same 
Cause we are apart 
Say the right word one more time 
You do it better than anyone 
I know that you feel the same 
I am just afraid you don't know 
What has become of you 
The secrets in your heart 
The love you had for me 
Will stay the same 
Cause we are apart 
Say the right word one more time 
Before I will be too old to hear you 
Once again you are not here to see 
The crying of my soul 
What has become of me 
The secrets in my heart 
The love I had for you 
Will stay the same 
Cause we are apart
