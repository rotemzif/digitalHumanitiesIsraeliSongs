Going in the no-entry zone 
feels ok to brag 
its ok to stay silent 
Would you expected from the other side 
I never look out 
I take in 
chancing after pictures long since lost 
comfort in time 
comfort in body 
comfort in mind 
A nice kind of lonely 
hot humid rain 
clearing the thick smell 
of unnatural behavior 
consider convenience 
you brave snail 
comfort in time 
comfort in body 
take comfort in mind 
It won't hurt you it may change you're mind 
I won't hurt you I may change you're mind
