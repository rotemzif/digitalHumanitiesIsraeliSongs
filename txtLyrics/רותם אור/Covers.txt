all I’ve got left
all I’ve got left
is covers
all I understand 
nothing’s changed
still in whispers
still in patterns
an instant message blocked
an instant message blocked
you’re blocked
when nothing meant a thing
I wish nothing meant a thing
to me too
do you think I win
do you think that I wanted to win
let’s end this song with a song
