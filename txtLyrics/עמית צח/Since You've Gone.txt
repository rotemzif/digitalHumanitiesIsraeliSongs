Tears have been falling from the sky
I took the rain home with me
Everything I have tried to hide
Everyone can see
I’ve learned to keep you out of sight
Locked in a box under my bed
No matter what I try to do
You’re still in my head
I feel you breathing beside me but you are not there
I try to reach you but all that I’m holding is air
And the salt on my face
Makes me thirsty for days
I would walk under your sun
And I want to be strong
I would say I was wrong
Cause nothing’s been right since you’ve gone
Tears have been falling from the sky
Wind is so cold I can’t breathe
Silence is taking hold of me
And it just won’t leave
I feel you passing beside me but you are not there
I try to touch you but all that I’m left with is air
And the salt on my face
Makes me thirsty for days
I would walk under your sun
And I want to be strong
I would say I was wrong
Cause nothing’s been right since you’ve gone
I would open the doors to the sky
By your wish I would live, I would die
I don’t know how to go on
Cause nothing’s been right since you’ve gone
