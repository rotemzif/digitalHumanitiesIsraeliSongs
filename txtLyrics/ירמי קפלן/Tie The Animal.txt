Before you leave your home 
Brush your teeth and put on your best clothes 
To hide what's underneath 
The things we fear might overcome us 
Don't forget to tie the animal 
Don't forget to hide the sickness 
Don't forget to tie the animal 
Forget to hide the sickness 
And before you speak 
Remember how many have spoken too loud 
So don't say the things you feel 
Some things are better off when they're left out 
Don't forget to tie the animal 
Don't forget to hide the sickness 
Don't forget to tie the animal 
Forget to hide the sickness 
Look at the animal 
Find its sickness 
Find its sickness 
Don't forget to tie the animal 
Don't forget to hide the sicknes 
Tie the animal 
And hide the sickness, hide the sickness 
Hide the sickness 
Look at the animal 
Find its sickness 
Look at the animal 
Find its sickness
