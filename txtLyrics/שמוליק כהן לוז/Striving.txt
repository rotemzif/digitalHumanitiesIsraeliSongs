Where is my desire?
Where are all my dreams?
Where is all the love that used to crawl under my skin?
Where is the fire that I used to spray?
Should I cross the river?
Should I draw a line?
Should I put myself in front or should I stand behind?
Should I tame my nature or should I let it stray?
Striving is my sin. Striving is my gain.
Striving is my wings. Striving is my pain.
Shall I start a battle? 
Shall I close my eyes?
Shall I follow simple ways to make you satisfied?  
Shall I dare perfection? Shall I leave loose ends?
Striving is my sin. Striving is my gain.
Striving is my wings. Striving is my pain.
In this darkness when you come around 
there's hope that helps me to unwind.
Still striving is my sin and striving is my gain.
"Try to make it simple", you say, 
"Try just to sustain there", you say, 
'cause striving is your wings and striving is your gain"
Am I really happy?
Am I just in chains?
Is there any way to keep insanity restrained?  
Will it really matter if I go away?
