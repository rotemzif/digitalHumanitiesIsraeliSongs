All of that precision
To be used in every sound
I get bored, I get bored
And all of these decisions
To be made in every round
I get lost, I get lost
And the fire that could take me
To the place that used to break me
Settles down
Kiss me now 'fore you go
Teach me how, I need to know
Slip me out your window
Underneath the surface
There's a weakness I have found
And I get scared, I get scared
And getting up is harder
When you're laying on the ground
I get lost, I get lost
But the gloom of my condition
Gets a higher definition
When you're gone
Kiss me now 'fore you go
Teach me how, I need to know
Yeah, I need to know
Slip me out your window
