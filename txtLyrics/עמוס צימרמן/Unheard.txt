This is the day we'll be taking back the power 
If all goes well we'll be kings within the hour 
And first against the wall 
The hypocrites and the cowards 
This is not the weight of the world 
This is not the color of my words 
And it's driving me away 
Driving me away unheard 
This is the style that's been out of style a long time ago 
But it's worth the while to convince myself you're mine, you know 
And first we take Manhattan 
Then we take tomorrow 
This is not the weight of the world 
This is not the color of my words 
And it's driving me away 
Driving me away unheard 
And far from here 
I can really be me again 
Can't you understand? 
This is the day we'll be taking back the power 
If all goes well we'll be kings within the hour 
And first against the hypocrites and the cowards 
This is not the weight of the world 
This is not the color of my words 
And it's driving me away 
Driving me away unheard
