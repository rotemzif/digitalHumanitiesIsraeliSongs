Waving at the sun you realize it all boils down To this one bit
Some things are always on the move while others stay in place and wait
Waiting for the healing drops of rain
To cool their eyes and dim their pain
Spinning round and round your eyes are echoing the glassy sounds of broken light
You're trying to remember who and what and how to play when moments turn
Racing down on memories' path ,butterflies
The roads are never long enough
Waiting for the healing drops of rain
To cool your eyes and ease the pain
Is it all just points of view
Am i just another you
Why do I still resist ?
I'm waving at the burning skies
No matter how hard I try
I just can't close my eyes
Waving at the sun
