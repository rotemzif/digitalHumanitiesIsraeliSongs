Everybody's taking 
turns on me right now 
And everybody knows 
that it's wrong 
but he do it at anyhow 
And you don't 
you don't have to stand so near and burn 
and burn and burn me with your eyes 
And I never cry 
cry 
Everybody is taking turns on me 
And everybody knows 
everybody knows 
that it's wrong 
but they do it at anyhow 
And you don't 
you don't 
have to stand so near and burn 
and burn 
and burning to the ground 
I don't wanna be the one who came 
I don't wanna be the one who came 
I wanna be the one the one who care 
I don't wanna be the one who came 
I don't wanna be the one who came 
I don't wanna be the one who came 
I wanna be the one the one who care 
I don't wanna be the one who came 
Last 
And I never cry 
cry
