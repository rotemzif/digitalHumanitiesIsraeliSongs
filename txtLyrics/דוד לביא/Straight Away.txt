I'm glad you asked me, I'm glad you did
It's nothing really, it's just I think it was too fast
Now I don't know what to answer
Don't give me time to think it through
Take my picture drunk on you on the bed on Christmas Eve
Not that we care much that it is
So I think I'll tell my parents what we did
'cause if they knew what we did
They would come and get me straight away
Come and get me straight away
Come and get me straight away
Come and get me straight away
So I'm glad you asked, I really am
It's nothing truly just I think it was to fast
Now I don't know what to tell you
You gave too much time to think
So now it's too late I must bring up the other stuff
That we both hate to mention - and I will
And so I'm gonna tell my parents what we did
And if they knew what we did
They would come and get me straight away
They would come and get me straight away
They would come and get me straight away
They would come and get me straight away
I've made up my mind
We'll leave them behind
We will get there, you do not know what I'm like
I think I'll tell my parents what we did
And if they knew what we did
They would come and get me straight away
They would come and get me straight away
They would come and get me straight away
They would come and get me straight away
