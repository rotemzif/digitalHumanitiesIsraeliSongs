Hear softness inside my head
My bed.
See Tel Aviv in the winter time
That's when people really look nice
Watch out, I tell myself look out

Watch out I tell myself lookout
Don't do those things you'll regret
Babe, does it hurt when I hide?
Stay, stay baby
Will you stay on my side?
Baby dose it hurt when I'm high?
Stay stay baby will you stay on my...
