On the bus
On the bus I must be the only one in the world.
Say your mine, oh say your mine
people look and laugh in a corner of my mind
 say your mine say your mine. 
I’ve wasted time inside others eyes 
say your mine oh say your mine
Crushed inside the crowd are the leftovers of my pride
 say you lied oh say you lied 
I feel the heat your words are burning under my feet
say you lied oh say you lied  
I’ve worked so hard to drive my own way out 
say you like it say you like 
Oh drive slow
you act like you know 
where I should 
go
On The Bus
