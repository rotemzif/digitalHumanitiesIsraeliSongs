I look at you now
You're in the eye of my mind
Thinking maybe I woke up, and it's 1969
And you just broke up the band
Had it all in the palm of your hand
But you didn't want none
Sitting on top of the world looking down
You said – "Baby, I'd rather be free"
And I'm walking down
A London street in the rain
You just happened to pass by
And you stopped to say
"Nothing ever just happens, it's all part of a bigger plan"
You had this idea 
About god being here all the time
Watching us
Words that you said linger on in my head
As I go again through the motions
Taking my time
Realizing that I'm just a ripple on the ocean of life
You used to say
At the end of the day
All the words that we said will be washed away
And all that remains will be echoes of the music we play
The opening chord of "my sweet lord"
On my car radio on the highway,
Still makes me feel like I knew you for real
And I'm glad you crossed my way in life.
I look at you now
You're in the eye of my mind
Thinking maybe I woke up…
