If you fall I will catch you
I promise I will
I will love you forever
Help you cross all the rivers
And the deserts, I swear
The this bond I won't sever
And I feel like somebody else
I feel like no one
I'm no one
If you can't walk the road
I will carry you through
I will hold you wherever
If you're scared in your bed
I will comfort you too
Sing you songs 'till whenever
And I feel like somebody else...
