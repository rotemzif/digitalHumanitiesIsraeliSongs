i'm gonna lose your admiration
i'm gonna look for secret doors
i'm gonna kill your inspiration
you've got to believe me
you've got to leave me
i'm gonna treat you like a temple
i'm gonna wash you every night
i'm gonna die for you my angel
you've got to believe me
you've got to leave me
you've got to believe me
that everything i do
i do for you... baby
and if you want me too
we don't need no body
i'm gonna be with you forever
i'm gonna mess your life once more
i'm gonna ask you for a favor
you've got to believe me
you've got to leave me
i'm gonna sleep with you tomorrow
i'm gonna make you see me cry
i'm gonna let you touch my sorrow
you've got to believe me
you've got to leave me
you've got to believe me
that everything i do
i do for you... baby
and if you want me too
we don't need no body
i'm gonna make you lose direction
i'm gonna see right through your lies
i'm gonna change your destination
you've got to believe me
you've got to leave me
