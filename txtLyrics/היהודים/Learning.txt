Learning how to dream
Learning how to scream
Learning how to stay awake
Learning how to fly
Learning not to cry
Learning how to take a break
Though you see me
I cannot see myself in your green eyes
And though you hear me
There's silence everywhere
I don't know why
Seaching for a goal
Seaching in our souls
Seaching underneath the fence
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for someone
Waiting while there is a chance
And though you see me
I cannot see myself in your green eyes
And though you hear me
There's silence everywhere
I don't know why
