Step by step I'm walking to your door
And step by step I want you even more
Hugging you
Missing you
Loving you
Leaving you
What are you thinking?
What about you?
Step by step I'm climbing on your wall 
And step by step I'm closer to your soul
Dance with me
Do it right
Stay with me
Hold me tight
What are you thinking?
What about you?
Please don’t leave me this way
Don’t want to be alone without you
Please don’t leave me this way
Don’t want to be alone without you
Step by step I'm walking to your room
And step by step I'm closer to the moon
Hugging you
Missing you
Loving you
Leaving you
What are you thinking?
What about you? 
What about you?
