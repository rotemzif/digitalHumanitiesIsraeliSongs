oh lord
let me go
cause my innocence
sometime makes me mad
god i'm so afraid
why can't you understand it?
lord
you got to let it be
you got to let it roll
just don't expect something
now what do you mean
i'm letting you go
cause i don't believe in anybody
anymore
it's everybody's war
oh lord
let me fall
cause i can not stand
knowing i'll be dead
makes me feel so scared
why can't you understand it?
lord
you got to let it be
you got to let it roll
just don't expect something
now what do you mean
i'm letting you go
cause i don't believe in anybody
anymore
it's everybody's war
