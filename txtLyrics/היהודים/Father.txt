no one hears me
no one sees me
no one makers me smile
no one misses me
no one kisses me
no one told me why
while you're trying to remember years go by
still afraid of your behavior who am i?
father
can you hear me?
can you feel my pain?
can you see me?
father
can you hear me?
can you feel my pain?
can you see me?
no one needs me
no one feeds me
no one wants to lie
since you left me
no one loves me
no one even tries
all those years are like a cancer in my mind
if i'll call you would you answer one last time
father
can you hear me?
can you feel my pain?
can you see me?
father
can you hear me?
can you feel my pain?
can you see me?
