They want to kill me
They want me bad
Please don't hurt me
Please don't hurt me
Give me just one day
To say good-bye to my lover
They want to feel me
They want me bad
Please don't hurt me
Please don't hurt me
Give me some silence
One chance to fly
to my lover
Cause i feel so low
Cause i feel
I feel so lonely
Don't need to feel the pain
Don't need to cry
Please don't hurt me
Please don't hurt me
give me some silence
One chance to fly
to my lover
