Dear Rabbi 
I'm at a crossroads
I called to ask a question
My heart was full of doubt.
Dear Rabbi
I'm on a sinking boat
I sailed into the ocean 
My aim is good
My soul is old
I'm mad about the boy
My spirit's full of joy 
I heard a calling from a distance
It was my son
Dear Rabbi
I lost my way for a while
I couldn't trust my intuition
My sight has failed me
Are you listening?
Dear Rabbi 
I prayed you came to me
I saw you in my dreams 
The message was so clear
My Dear child don't worry
Be patient
Remain silent                                      
My dear child
Three months you told me
The truth will come
The river of answer will flow
And you'll know
I'm mad about the boy
My spirit's full of joy 
I heard a calling from a distance
It was my son
