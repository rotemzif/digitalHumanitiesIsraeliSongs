Home again
Home again
One day I know
I'll feel home again
Wrong again
Wrong again
One day I know
I'll feel strong again
And lift my head
Many times
I've been told
All this talk
Will make you old
So, I'll close my eyes
Won't look behind
Movin' on
Movin' on
So I'll close my eyes
Won't look behind
Movin' on
Lost again
Lost again
One day I know
Our paths will cross again
Smile again
Smile again
One Day I hope
To make you smile again
And I won't hide
Many times
I've been told
Speak your mind, just be bold
So I'll close my eyes
Won't look behind
Movin' on
Movin' on
So, I'll close my eyes
And the tears will clear
Then I'll feel no fear
Then I'd feel no way
Bypass what we made straight
Home again
Home again
One day I know
I'll feel home again
