Wrapped in a bow 
The winter drops by 
Silence breaks couples when January comes 
Leaves you lurking in the night light 
Fingers that used to lie 
Leave a mouth to dry 
Leave the city dying 
And your women crying 
If you see the light of day 
You won't recognize the sun 
Aha aha 
and Catching magic in a box 
Won't make you live like one of us 
Oh you king of fools 
Your window's always left unshut 
As if the wind can bring you everything you've lost 
It's too late to think about it 
Does your guitar still play 
Remember purple haze 
I'm pretty sure you do 
In fact you smoked that too 
If you seeâ€¦ 
People have lost their minds 
they Left their lives behind 
The place on which you're standing, it isn't elevating
