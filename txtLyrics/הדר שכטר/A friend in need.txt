We met when we were just 16
We hit it off instantly
There was a boy sitting right next to us
He vanished mysteriously
We talked about basketball and foxy brown
Wrote rhymes up on the wall
You lost your mom
I buried my dad
You were the strongest of us all
The strongest of us all
We met some guys through out the years
We laughed about each and every one
And when you came back from India
Your heart knew it was done
I met mine a long time ago
That never bothered us
But each year thats passed, you took a step back 
And I tried to catch up
I tried to catch up
Yeah
And when you wore that dress
You know I shed a tear
It was like I was letting you go
To the life you've always wanted
So dearly
You were a friend of mine
For some reason now you've gone
And I'll be trying to catch up with you
And your ridin' towards the sun
Arizona sounds sweet and clear
Maybe that's just what you need
Just remember when you come back here
I once was that 
I was once your friend in need
Yeah
