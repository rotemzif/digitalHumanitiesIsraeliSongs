Your intentions were always quite crossed 
I knew exactly what you wanted 
And now it's clear 
That the love I got was soon to disappear 
My love was blemished by your egoistic ways 
Of keeping me near 
And it's no shame to admit that you are my fear 
But I carried on 
Even when love was crying out not to let you stay 
Carried on 
As my love was screaming at you go away 
I know that the things I gave up will eventually take their toll 
And I saw you take the reins out of my need for control 
I came across as supernatural 
How silly that was 
And now I'm robbed from my powers 
Caught in your fire 
And all because 
I carried on 
Even when love was crying out 
Not to let you stay 
Carried on as my love was screaming at you go away 
I loved what we had when we were together 
Doing whatever 
Couples do when they're in love 
But I know you can't take it 
So I'll let you have it 
For a while 
I carried on...
