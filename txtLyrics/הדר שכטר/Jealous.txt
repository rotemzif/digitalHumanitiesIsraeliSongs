She's having a baby on the second floor 
And you're in the living room waiting 
Waiting anticipating 
She's crying now but it won't be long 
And you wonder when your train will come to take you along 
And you're jealous 
Jealous than you've ever been before 
You can't help it 
You've seen so much it hurts 
If I could I would 
Help you save your self 
But this battle is you own 
He bought her a ring 
Just a year since you've been gone 
And you say he doesn't love her 
It's just for show 
And he cares for her like you know he cared for you 
But your ship never takes no prisoners 
And you're jealous… 
They won't let you be 
The Happy girl you were meant to be 
Always proving you on everything you've ever done wrong 
Where's that friend in need when you need it? 
And you're jealous…
