Hey now Mr. Rockstar 
Who do you think you are?! 
Driving down the street in daddy's jaguar 
Cut the act, take off the mask 
What are you waiting for?! 
Fed up, Fed up 
Can't trust anyone 
You know you can't trust anyone 
Fed up, Fed up 
Don't tell me what i need 
Don't you ever lie to me 
Don't tell me what i wanna hear you say... (hear you say...) 
Money is your god and your whole image is a lie 
Can't make it on your own 
Too busy stealing other people's pride 
Take off that "fancy" suit 
You're just a spoiled child 
Bow down before the power that has always owned your life 
Fed up, Fed up... 
Don't you ever lie to me 
Don't tell me what i wanna hear you say... (hear you say...)
