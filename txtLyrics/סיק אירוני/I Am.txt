It will take me time to forget 
what they did to me 
I won't let this happen again 
Can't you let me be 
They broke me down and played with my head 
they took my thouhgts an told me I'm dead 
They say I'm wrong, they say I'm insane 
I know who I am! 
I'm NOT afraid! 
I won't let their decay touch me 
Now, here, today! 
Now it's time for the change 
Gotta stop the illusion 
I choose to know don't hide 
I choose to be free 
I choose to know don't hide 
Let your mind grow 
They pretend to help and create 
- It's all so fake 
Freedom knocks it's time to awake 
- I will choose my fate 
(They) Control you with i deas full of hate 
Open your eyes, It's never too late 
Truth awaits, see what I see 
Denial locks you up 
truth will set you free 
I choose to know don't hide... 
What do you want from me?! 
What did you say!? What did you say?! 
Let me be, set me free 
let me live my own destiny 
Let me go, I just know 
I'll decide what's right or wrong for me 
Look through me, I can see 
the truth will let us all go free 
Freedoms here, oh so near 
denial locks you up and it... 
won't let go, won't let you know
