Staring at the TV screen 
Lost between the right, the wrong 
the real, the unreal 
I can feel my mind 
getting weaker, getting weaker 
Tired of these bullshit lies 
Fake commercials telling me 
how i should buy my "Perfect" life 
I can feel my mind 
getting weaker, getting weaker 
I'm losing my mind 
Wasting my time 
What is wrong with... 
Me... N-Atrophy 
I must awake or Fade Away 
Politicians fake their care 
while letting millions bleed 
Sensing war in the air 
but who the hell are we?! 
(Some Democracy!?) 
Fashion now designed 
to play with our minds 
Hold us to the ground 
I cannot breathe 
getting weaker, getting weaker 
I'm losing my mind...
