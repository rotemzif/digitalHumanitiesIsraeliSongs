Nothing ever changes 
everything just always stays the same 
We always run in circles 
seems like no one can stop the burning flame 
How much more shit must you swallow 
in order to wake up from the sleep? 
How red must the sign on the wall be 
in order to make you stop the bleed?! 
Sleep tight my child 
Shut your eyes and rephrase the lies 
Now that you have seen the light 
Some things are worth dying for... 
Sacrifice Philosophy (is) the road 
we choose to follow 
Bounded to the vacancy - blindfolded 
Victims of our apathy 
the Victims of Tomorrow 
Wake up! We're turning too cold 
Another tear drops on a grave 
...one of thousands 
burned down by the flame 
With the sadness comes the rage 
eating reason, letting it over come 
spread its pain 
Vengeance calls! 
"Someone has to pay!" 
In the name of whatever, whoever 
does it even matter at all?! 
Preaching only one thing in our minds 
Preaching hate, sacrifice 
"There are things worth dying for" 
Wake up my child! 
Open your eyes and embrace their lies 
Now that you see the light 
Some things are worth living for... 
Sacrifice Philosophy (is) the road... 
We're turning too cold... 
too cold, too cold
