Every day seems like yesterday 
A routine of growing pain 
The shame inside over running me 
So I hide inside my shell 
Hey man! Don't be afraid - 
You better... 
Face it! Decide how the story ends 
You better Face it! 
Don't turn your back on yourself 
You've left me behind with these memories 
yet all i see is just the blame 
Oh please god! Could you make it stop! 
Could you help me turn the page 
Don't turn your back on yourself! 
You better... 
Face it! Decide how the story ends 
You better face it! 
Don't turn your back on yourself 
"Save me! Show me there can be another way" 
Together, my friend, we will face it once again 
Face it 
Don't let it bring you down...
