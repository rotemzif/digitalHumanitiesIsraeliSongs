Sometimes you have to hate 
in order to love again 
Sometimes you have to break 
in order to rebuild yourself even stronger 
You wish i could lift you up and hold your hand 
Walk you through these wasted lands 
Always think! Never follow 
Then you're just one step away 
from what you wanna be... 
What you wanna be 
(One step away, one step away) 
You wish i could 
clear the smoke that is in your eyes 
Show you the way to the other side... 
to the other side 
Wake up! Remember where you come from 
Don't look back, don't look down 
aim at where you wanna go 
You wish i was always there to take the lead 
Pull you up back on your feet 
Remind you to never give up 
Don't forget you know you're just one step away 
from what you wanna be... 
What you wanna be 
You wish i could 
clear the smoke that is in your eyes 
Show you the way to the other side... 
to the other side 
It's just one step away...one step away
