Give me a reason, to forgive for all the pain 
and suffering you have caused 
Behind a mask of perfection 
(you) lie to yourself 
afraid to face your own flaws 
Just say "I'm sorry" 
Say that you're sorry now 
Say that you're sorry 
Just say that you're sorry now! 
Times have changed 
I'm here and I take a stand! 
Drive me away?! You'll never! 
Forever here to stay! 
Never again! 
I won't let you tread on me! 
REMEMBER AND NEVER FORGET! 
Hate was the only option 
for those who knew nothing more 
And fate was the only answer 
for those who lost everything in the war 
It's unbelievable how sometimes 
one man's face can be so deceiving 
Ironic how (the) persistant search 
after the deliverance 
can make one man's voice be so misleading 
Just say "I'm sorry" 
Say that you're sorry now 
Say that you're sorry 
Just say that you're sorry now! 
Times have changed... 
There are certain truths 
which stand out so openly 
on the roadside of life, as it were 
that every passer-by may see them 
Yet, because of their very obviousness 
the general run of people disregard such truths 
or at least they do not make them 
the object of any conscious knowledge 
Times have changed... 
People are so blind 
to some of the simplest facts 
in everyday life 
They are highly surprised when somebody 
calls attention to 
what everybody ought to know
