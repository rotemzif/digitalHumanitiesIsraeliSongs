Rock'n'Roll vibe emerging from the inside 
building up, breaking out, tearin' apart 
every bone in your body, every muscle's alive 
Can you feel it? Yeah... 
It's taking over your mind 
It's when the old meets the new 
in a different way 
Rock'n'Roll religion stepping out of frame 
Rock'n'Roll and Techno in a perfect blend 
makes you wanna jump and bang your head 
Tech, Tech, Tech, Tech, Tech and Roll 
Expend your mind and save your soul 
You gotta cross the line and lose control 
Jump up and shout it out! 
Bass drum beat guides to the rhythm 
inslaving you, makes you wanna move your feet 
Adrenalin, let it spread through the system 
enjoy the trance, can you feel the heat? 
Raise your hands up in the air 
Shout it out loud like you just don't care 
Hey! This is Tech'n'Roll! 
Move your body and enjoy the show! 
Tech, Tech, Tech, Tech, Tech and Roll... 
I need some 
Tech, Tech, Tech, Tech, Tech and Roll! 
You need some 
Tech, Tech, Tech, Tech, Tech and Roll! 
Jump up and shout it out
