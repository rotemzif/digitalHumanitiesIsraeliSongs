What if I told you I had an answer 
to eternity, infinity, a never ending end 
What if I told you i had an answer 
a truth, a meaning, trapped in my head 
What if I told you I had the key 
the key for life, sense and prosperity 
What if I told you I had it all 
I gave it up so one day, maybe 
i could be free, just be 
Now you realize 
- what you could have had 
Walk through the foot steps left behind 
- Open up your eyes 
after all this time - 
Come Back 2 Life 
What if I told I had this craving 
this need to be like no one else 
What if I told you i believe in meaning 
in NOT to cave like all the rest 
Why must we live through regulation?! 
You should live your life for yourself 
Don't ever let the consequences put you down 
and take the risk 
I wanna reach my hands so high 
Stop the BLEED and touch the sky 
I want to feel alive! 
Now you realize... 
Now you realize 
the life you could have had 
If you only tried...
