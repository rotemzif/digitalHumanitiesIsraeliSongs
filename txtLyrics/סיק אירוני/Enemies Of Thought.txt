Hey you! Step back in place 
you are changing the pace 
Obey! Respect the system! 
That's you! a man with no face 
just a slave tied in chains 
colored dark shade of grey 
Step back in line 
Adapt yourself 
Don't speak! Just march and fight 
Salute the legacy of hate 
I will not preach the words you're prayin' 
I cannot hear the lies you're sayin' 
I do not fear what you think 
Will NOT bend down and kneel 
Do you believe what they say 
"it'll all be OK if you pray day by day" 
Get real! Open yourself 
to a new different way 
if you dare just ask yourself... 
Who are you now? 
Be strong my friend 
It's time to step aside 
and break this legacy of hate 
I will not preach the words they're prayin 
I cannot hear the lies they're sayin' 
I do not fear what they think 
Will NOT bend down and kneel 
You should not preach the words they're prayin' 
Don't help them spread the lies they're sayin' 
Don't be afraid of what they think 
Just be the change you wish to see 
Walls are caving in 
can you feel the panic, rage within 
It's penetrating 
Can't tell what is real 
when you cannot trust the things you feel 
Do NOT bend down and kneel
