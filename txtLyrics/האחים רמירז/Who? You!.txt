I'm gonna love you pretty baby both night and day
I'll hand you my heart on a golden tray    
Been waiting such a long time for something new
Been shooting in the dark till I met you
Who? You!
Been walking down the streets a long weary mile     
With smoke in my fists and then I've seen your smile
Maybe I bit off more than I can chew     
It's all I want, I know it's you      
Who? You!
Come on baby take my hand
Let your little heart expand
In a cotton candy dream
Floating down the river stream
Who?
Gonna love you pretty baby both night and day
I'll hand you my heart on a golden tray      
Been waiting such a long time for something new
Been shooting in the dark till I met you
Who? You!
