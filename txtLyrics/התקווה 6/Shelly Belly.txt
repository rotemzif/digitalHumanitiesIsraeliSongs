Pull over, show me your registration 
Hope you understand the reason for my action 
He said pull over, illegal combination 
You can't drive a car with a phone inna your hand 
Said poor Shelly Belly shocking information 
She tried to tell her side of the situation 
"Tell it to the judge â€“ that is my consolation"

Shelly have decided to fight this ya one 
Claiming in court: "I'm an innocent woman" 
She had good answers inna interrogation 
But policeman forgot to answer one question 
He said: "Me can't remember each and every person" 
But how can he forget Shelly's style and fashion 
You tan deh officer me want investigation 
You need more responsibility in your occupation

Miss judge she had a miss judgment 
It us a word against word argument 
To justice the court is ignorant 
Maybe the whole organization needs some improvement 
Politician & police officer seem to have a lead 
When the system haffi swallow almost anything them feed 
We shout: "Equal rights is what we need"
