		She aksed me:"how you doin'"? me told her :"I'm fine"
We will soon take the papers I need you to sign
But take a step back now and stand inna the line
"how rude!" and so me stood it wasn't that quick

After a minute or two me felt homesick
And so me called me girlfriend but she doesn't want to speak anymore…

And then finally it was my turn

She took a likkle peace of paper she said: "we're almost done"
