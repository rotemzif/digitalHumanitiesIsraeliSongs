We nuh fear them, oh we nuh fear them
Yes we are ready for the struggle
We come near them, oh we come near them
Yes we are ready
Watch out!
We nuh need no gun we nuh need ammunition
Only rightehousness and observation
To talk about a problem may bring solution
So turn your weakness into motivation
Because me know say we are drowning in corruption
But me nuh go let them drown we with no caution
Politricks yo  a fi abort this negative mission
Of misleading the country and its population
Bring more workers workers, nuff ambition
Society needs renovation
 Bring more workers workers, nuff ambition
Give a likkle help fi me nation yeah

So you better pass another light
Babylon go down

Them pon of me everywhere but me know say them all a do wrong
Them pon of me here, them pon of me there
Them pon of me everywhere but me know say me haffi be strong
Democracy is dead, now isn't that funny?
Only one world leader Mr. president money
But nuh get me wrong, in this material life
You need a likkle cash in order to survive
But awareness is a most so freedom and love
Being a good man is the way that I chose
Awareness is a most so freedom and love
Being a good man is the that I chose
Pass another light...
