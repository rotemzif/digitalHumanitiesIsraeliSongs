Well it's another on for them leaders
Well it's another one for politicians
Well it's another one fi all them people who need to stand up and raise them voice loud!
All of my people who want a new leader
And if you want a new prime minister
Them a shout a new president
Change change this government
For a better environment
Long time my people have been searching
Fi the wright man and fi the wright leading
Someone fi guide them and keep them moving
Through the very raggy raggy road of leading
But we give away each and evey opportunity
We give new definition for integrity
We think we got solution, we got vanity
And still waiting in vain for jah's deputy
All of my people...
United in this division
A critical time for every decision
We got to wise up and get to the mission and bring
Humanity should be a coalition and still
No politician, no politician
Nobody come with good solution still
No politician, no politician
We need an I-phone application come!
All of my people...
Who run tings? Say who a run tings?
Who run tings? Say who a run tings?
Who run tings? Say who a run tings?
Who run tings? Say who a run tings?
Well it's another on for them leaders
Well it's another one for politicians
Well it's another one for Jean Claude Van Damme
