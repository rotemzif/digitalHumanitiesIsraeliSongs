When she came out of the ocean
Never have seen such devotion
Didn't imagine you'd want to stay
Calling me over to make mistakes
Last of the words you have spoken
Broken embraces seem solemn
Pouring it out of an empty face
Fighting exhaustion to stay awake
Changes I've seen in your heart
Trying to take it apart
These are the ways that it starts
Changes I've seen in your heart
Eyes that glow bright in the moonlight
Mountains that move under blood skies
Years that keep slipping out of my head
Turn into nothing and fade away
Changes I've seen in your heart
Trying to take it apart
These are the ways that it starts
Changes I've seen in your heart
