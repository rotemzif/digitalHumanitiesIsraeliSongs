It 's a new chapter spot lights and flash so so super fresh
Yo I'm gonna set the world on fire get my music out is all that I desire so let your body move while I inject this in your vains 
Sync your heart beat bpm we're about to go insane
I'm feeling that the rhythm controls my heart 
And it's taking over the pain
I'm feeling the melody reach in to my soul 
And there is no need to hide from the rain
I'm feeling the sun is up in the sky waving down and saying hello
I'm hearing the dj up on the mic say: "hup on the rhythm and let yourself go…"

And there is no need to hide from the rain

I'm hearing the dj up on the mic say: "hup on the rhythm and let yourself go…"
