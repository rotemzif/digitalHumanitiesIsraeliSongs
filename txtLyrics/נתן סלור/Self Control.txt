Oh, the night is my world, city light painted girl 
In the day nothing matters, it's the night time that flatters 
In the night, no control, through the wall something's breaking 
Wearing white as you're walkin' down the street of my soul 
You take my self, you take my self control 
You got me livin' only for the night 
Before the morning comes, the story's told 
You take my self, you take my self control 
Another night, another day goes by 
I never stop myself to wonder why 
You make me to forget to play my role 
You take my self, you take my self control 
I, I live among the creatures of the night 
I haven't got the will to try and fight 
Against a new tomorrow, so I guess I'll just believe it 
That tomorrow never comes 
A safe night, I'm living in the forest of my dream 
I know the night is not as it would seem 
I must believe in something, so I'll make myself believe it 
That this night will never go
