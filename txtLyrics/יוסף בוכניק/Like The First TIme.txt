Wasted all my time
Not knowing that I'm going away
breaking into pieces
Letting you decide now who I am
I'm falling now
I'm falling now
Looking for your guidance in this dark place
God knows what I'm doing here
Searching for the answers
Of my past
Not knowing when to quit when I know that I'm all alone
Not knowing when to stop something
Something I know is wrong
Chorus:
And you are there to make sure I'm not lost
Standing in the corner with your fingers crossed
Knowing if I'm gone
  knowing if i'm lost
She'll find me like the first time
In the place where they stopped all the jokes
I stood there with my bleeding soul
Crying for help
Where no one could here
And you said "hush baby now you're ok
I was here all along the way
Don't ever stop singing your song
Bleed out for me it'll make you strong"
And as her words faded out
She ripped out her heart and hand it over
"it's yours to take"
And all my past has gone away.
Chorus:
And you are there to make sure I'm not lost
Standing in the corner with your fingers crossed
Knowing if I'm gone
  knowing if i'm lost
She'll find me like the first time
