i'm here to say a word or two 
in the name of love and innocence 
it's been a long time they've been out of style, 
but i won't live in illusion, 
there's not much chance that things will change on lonely planet earth. 
all that is natural, all that is free 
like me loving you, and you loving me, 
like the sweet fruit growing on a tree, 
like the blood-red choral in the sea, 
like shaking hands and sharing food, 
and a real creative attitude 
and a big strong hug,yes, that feels good, 
and the miracle of birth 
shalom shalom, 
shalom shalom shalom, 
shalom shalom, 
shalom shalom shalom 
you really don't need a diploma 
from any university 
to understand and to enjoy 
this plentiful diversity 
you only need to clean your mind of all those pre-conceptions 
and use your mouth for laughing and for asking and to kiss… 
communicate, communicate, 
don't think: "oh lord, i've come too late!" you're always welcome at love's gate 
to wash your feet of fear and hate 
so when you come and when you go, 
the words are peace, goodbye, hello, 
in a language that I know it goes like this: 
shalom shalom,shalom... 
so if our strategy is love 
(don't bite my head off, i said love) 
and you say: "duuuh, 
so simple!" 
yeah, but easy to miss…. 
so when you come and when you go, 
so when you come and when you go, 
the words are peace, goodbye, hello, 
in a language that I know it goes like this: 
shalom shalom,shalom...
