we’re born we’re crying 
we fall we’re trying 
we’re little we’re laughing 
we’re lonely sometimes 
we grow we’re open 
we’re lost we’re hoping 
we’re careful we’re calling 
we’re leaving behind 
you say we need to work together 
with love and care for everyone 
without the fighting and the anger 
you say the world could be as one 
but every time that you say we 
do you think about me? 
‘cause every time that you say we 
i hope you think about me 
we’re strong we’re chosen 
we’re scared we’re frozen 
we’re hardened we’re hopeful 
we’re holding at bay 
we take we’re giving 
we shake we’re living 
we’re lovers we’re sinners 
we’re running away 
and if we fail to make a difference 
and if our hope is almost gone 
despite the fighting and the anger 
you say the world could be as one 
but every time that you say we 
do you think about me? 
‘cause every time that you say we 
i hope you think about me 
and every time that you say we 
do you think about me? 
‘cause every time that you say we 
i hope you think about me
