And the road and the road 
and the car and the car 
and your wrist touching my hair 
we know we are traveling far, far 
but we haven’t decided on where 
and the sound of my name in your mouth 
is spicy and sweet, or soft as a prayer 
I say, lets turn to the south, 
there is nothing and everything there 
There’s a bottle of water, a bag of dates, 
an orange that I can peel 
I can tell you a story, or sing if you want, 
if you’re falling asleep at the wheel 
we can talk about when we were kids 
and we thought there was nothing we couldn’t achieve 
then years passed by and blinded our eyes 
now we need something else to believe 
oooh, something else to believe... 
You are silent for hours, I humm, and I humm 
I feel on the verge of a song 
I wait for the words to come when they come 
lucky the road is long 
and the music I hear in my head 
is the dance of the wind 
sweeping over the plain 
the shade of your eyes 
the shifting skies. 
and the rest, only love can explain. 
ooooh, only love can explain 
At the top of the mountain the view is stunning 
but soon it gives way to the night 
you say you can tell it’s the end of the tunnel 
you ask if I've seen the light 
the slope is steep 
but the road keeps taking us down 
to the river below 
the sound of the wheels, the endless fields 
and I'll go wherever you go 
oooo, go wherever you go 
and the road and the road 
and the car and the car 
and my eyes are watching your hands 
we know we are traveling far, far 
and we know the road never ends... 
so lets talk about when we were kids 
and we thought there was nothing we couldn’t achieve 
then years passed by 
and blinded our eyes, 
now we need something else to believe 
oooh, something else to believe...
