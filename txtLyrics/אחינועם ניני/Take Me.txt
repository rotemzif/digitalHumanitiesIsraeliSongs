Take me, take me as I am 
take me, don't let go my hand 
take the part of me that strives to reach the light 
take my hand and lead me through the darkest night 
hold me, when I'm feeling low 
hold me, never let me go 
hold the part of me that fears the setting sun 
hold my hand and tell of better days to come 
everyone I know plays games 
everybody's so untrue 
when it's over what remains 
nobody but me and you 
hold me, when I fall apart 
hold me, closer to your heart 
hold the part of me that vibrates when I sing 
hold me so I'm not afraid of anything 
everyone I know plays games 
everybody's so untrue 
when it's over what remains 
nobody but me and you 
so take me, take me as I am 
take me, don't let go my hand... 
take the part of me that strives to reach the light 
take my hand and lead me through the darkest night 
take me as I am 
(never let me go...) 
take me as I am
