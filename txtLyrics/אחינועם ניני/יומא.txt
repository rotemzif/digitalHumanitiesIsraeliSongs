Oh father, mother 
Don't make me marry him for money 
I love another 
Whose eyes are kind and lips are honey 
The cattle grazing fields are free 
So why enbondage me 
Your cows and oxen can be sold 
Do not enslave my soul 
Oh father, mother 
Your nights are stormed 
With rain and thunder 
Oh father, mother 
Your nights are stormed 
With rain and thunder 
The water gushing from the sky 
Is teardrops from my eyes 
The thunder tearing skies apart 
The Beating of my heart
