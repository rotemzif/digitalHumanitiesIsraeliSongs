Hold your hand high so I can see you 
There're many hands above, I cannot see 
Many questions asked, many more unanswered 
I'm waiting here so you can hide from me 
So life is like a carousel 
You think you're going up, you'd better think again 
There's no one saying that we can 
We keep on turning wheels, and for what? 
I don't understand 
Hold your breath tight, so I can hear you 
When people die, they are most likely to be heard 
In all this chaos, where are the stories 
Of happy lifetimes and a big carousel? 
So life is like a carousel 
You think you're going up, you'd better think again 
There's no one saying that we can 
We keep on turning wheels, and for what? 
I don't understand 
Hold your head up, so I can kiss you 
When lips are touched we feel connected in a way 
Let's go to sleep, so I can hold you 
Oh wait, you're not around to do this anymore 
So life is like a carousel 
You think you're going up, you'd better think again 
There's no one saying that we can 
We keep on turning wheels, and for what? 
I don't understan 
You wanna save me, go ahead...
