Sometimes I'd rather be alone 
The site of melody keeps me warm 
I'm not the same I'm not a free bird anymore 
First be a man before you go 
Stop chasing meaningless cures 
For a disease that doesn't live here anymore 
Sometimes I wonder who to blame 
Sometimes I'm wearing all the shame 
You are the closest thing to heaven for me 
First be a child before you sing 
Think of the ones you've never seen 
I'm not the same I'm not a free bird anymore 
Free bird, sing me a song, take me home 
Do what you can to bring me back 
From this hole, I can't take it anymore 
I'm waiting for you my free bird 
Sometimes I see you on a street 
Sometimes it was meant for us to meet 
But I was seeing many thoughts instead of you 
Maybe I'm used to thinking a lot 
Maybe I'm really what you're not 
I'm not the same I'm not a free bird anymore 
Free bird… 
And if I told you that I wasn't alone 
That every second she was there by my side 
And when you left me I started seeing it wrong, I almost died, I almost died. 
Free bird…
