I wish we were a photograph
Where every colour’s made to last
And who would know
That the cracks would show
And who could know
Cos everybody’s watching
And telling me it’s nothing
But I’m staring at an outline that used to be colourful
Now we’re only shades of what used to be beautiful
Keep trying to stop the rain from washing us away
I can’t bear to watch another colour fade
How could you forget how we used to be colourful
There’s a distance in every touch
Feels like we’re hanging on the edge of us
And who would know
That the cracks would show
And who could know
Cos everybody’s watching
And telling me it’s nothing
I’m staring at an outline that used to be colourful
Now we’re only shades of what used to be beautiful
Keep trying to stop the rain from washing us away
I can’t bear to watch another colour fade
How could you forget how we used to be colourful
