A broken sun-ray meets my window 
A few more moments of fading light
Naked trees, the stars are singing 
Someone else's song tonight
I know your crimes, your guilty pleasures
The lies you weave to leave tonight
It feels so wrong, your heart is distant
Cuz' someone else is on your mind
I thought I knew you 
But the night was calling
I was slowly dying
I thought I knew you
Love is blinding
I never saw it coming
There's no place left for me
We're losing it all but you can't see
There's no where else to go 
No place to be
Beauty paints a perfect picture
A blooming love for all to see
She doesn't know your weak devotion
But she'll find out the same as me
I thought I knew you
But the night was calling
I was slowly dying
I thought I knew you
Love is blinding
She'll never see it coming
There's no place left for me
We're losing it all but you can't see
There's no where else to go 
No place to be
The habit of the beast
Destroys me beat by beat
A snake may change his skin, his face, but not his nature
There's no place left for me
We're losing it all but you can't see
There's no where else to go 
No place to be
