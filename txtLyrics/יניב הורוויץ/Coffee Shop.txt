Goin’ to work at the coffee shop 
If it’s coffee you want 
Well, it’s coming right up. 
Goin’ to work at the coffee shop 
Short cup of black, well, I’ll cough it right up. 
Goin’ back to “Coffeeville”, 
Just off the long road, the same old drill. 
A cinnamon roll, a cup of warm tea, 
My apron comes on, it’s work for me. 
Cigarettes, Angry “gents”, on their way, 
Stop to take a sip of another gray day 
Make it smooth, make it dark, make it short, make it hot, 
Serve it with a smile and wait for their o.k. 
Goin’ to work… 
The sun comes up from a coffee cup, 
As the ladies take a seat at the table out back. 
Nice perky wives of respectable men, 
Who work long days to make the money they spend 
A couple walks in, a senior checks out, 
The faces change, but the expressions not. 
They sit and stair, poke their hair, Hopin’ for someone to care. 
Jabbing off the aspects of the complex life. 
Goin’ to work… 
The sun comes down on the coffee shop 
served my time, served my cup 
Find an overdressed man, my boss on display, 
Mumble a “goodbye” and I’m on my way. 
Comin’ back from the coffee shop, 
If it’s coffee you want, come back at 8 o’clock. 
Comin’ back from the coffee shop 
To make the best of the time I’ve got now
