I dont need you..
I dont need you..
I dont need you..
I dont you to tell me what I can do 
Where I can go And I dont need you to tell me 
What I can know what I can not know
I dont need you to tell me
Who I can see who I can not see
I dont you to tell me who I can be with
Who I can be not
I dont need you to tell me who I can be with tonight
And if it feels right
That is only my
That is only my 
That is only my
My right
I dont you to tell me what I can do 
Where I can go And I dont need you to tell me 
What I can know what I can not know
I dont need you to tell me
Who I can see who I can not see
I dont you to tell me who I can be with
Who I can be not
I dont need you to tell me who I can be with tonight
And if it feels right
That is only my
That is only my
That is only my
My right
Next time dont try to control me
Think again couse you dont own me
Im on my own now 
Im on my own now 
Next time dont try to control me
Think again couse you dont own me
Im on my own now 
Im on my own now
