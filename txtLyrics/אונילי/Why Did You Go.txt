Don't you know how intense my love is
Poor heart , oh girl, now it's broken
Leave all them boys alone
hear my voice calling your name
no I don't have enough of you
come back downstairs
I know you ohhhhhh
But you're moving too slowwwww
why did you go?
Where there things that you needed to know
Ohhh
don't you fall, don't you build up this wall
our hearts are too tired and too loaded
I wanted to taste your flavor
put my head on your shoulder
Boy I'm still in love
Still in love
I know you ohhhhhh
But you're moving too slowwwww
why did you go?
Where there things that you needed to know
Ohhh
You are my little starlight
my own private moon
]pull me into  your magic
I'm under your spell , a fool for you
Don't don't you play with the words that you say
because the doors that you open and close
leave me broken
Why be so cruel
you know that love has no rules
might not always belong to you
might go elsewhere 
I know you ohhhhhh
But you're moving too slowwwww
why did you go?
Where there things that you needed to know
Ohhh
