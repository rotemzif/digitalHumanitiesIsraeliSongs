Charge! By Electra
Going out on the weekend 
 Frontline boys left behind 
 Never show them your weakness 
 C’mon let’s see some lines 
2, 3, 4 
Charge! If you wanna prove 
You can really feel something
This is war
Fight with your dancing shoes
Ring the bell and get hammered
‘Cross the floor 
Jeans get out of the closet 
 Freedom can’t be denied 
 No means are forbidden 
Tear gas gets in your eyes ,Girl
Charge! C’mon make a move 
 Don’t just sit like a coffin
This is war
Fight with your dancing shoes
Be the bell be the hammer 
 ’Cross the floor
A thing of beauty 
 What the hell is the time
Like in the movies 
 No one’s drawing the line
Can you see me 
Getting on with the girls
Shake your booty 
And the hell with it all 
Charge! Get into the groove 
 Try hard to feel something 
 This is war
Fight with your dancing shoes
Do the chicken, the hammer
‘Cross the floor 
Charge! If you wanna prove
You can really feel something
This is war 
 Fight with your dancing shoes
Be the bell be the hammer
‘Cross the floor
