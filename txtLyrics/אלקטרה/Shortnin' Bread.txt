Put on the skillet, 
Slip on the lid, 
Mama's gonna make 
A little short'nin' bread. 
That ain't all 
She's gonna do, 
Mama's gonna make 
A little coffee, too. 
Mama's little baby loves 
Short'nin', short'nin', 
Mama's little baby loves 
Short'nin' bread, 
Mama's little baby loves 
Short'nin', short'nin', 
Mama's little baby loves 
Short'nin' bread. 
Three little children, 
Lyin' in bed 
Two were sick 
And the other 'most dead 
Sent for the doctor 
And the doctor said, 
"Give those children some 
Short'nin' bread." 
Mama's little baby loves 
Short'nin', short'nin', 
Mama's little baby loves 
Short'nin' bread, 
Mama's little baby loves 
Short'nin', short'nin', 
Mama's little baby loves 
Short'nin' bread. 
Mama's little baby loves 
Short'nin', short'nin', 
Mama's little baby loves 
Short'nin' bread, 
Mama's little baby loves 
Short'nin', short'nin', 
Mama's little baby loves 
Short'nin' bread. 
When those children, 
Sick in bed, 
Heard that talk 
About short'nin' bread, 
Popped up well 
To dance and sing, 
Skipped around and cut 
The pigeon wing. 
Mama's little baby loves 
Short'nin', short'nin', 
Mama's little baby loves 
Short'nin' bread, 
Mama's little baby loves 
Short'nin', short'nin', 
Mama's little baby loves 
Short'nin' bread. 
Slip to the kitchen, 
Slip up the led, 
Filled my pockets full of 
Short'nin' bread; 
Stole the skillet, 
Stole the led, 
Stole the gal makin' 
Short'nin' bread. 
Mama's little baby loves 
Short'nin', short'nin', 
Mama's little baby loves 
Short'nin' bread, 
Mama's little baby loves 
Short'nin', short'nin', 
Mama's little baby loves 
Short'nin' bread. 
Caught me with the skillet, 
Caught me with the led, 
Caught me with the gal makin' 
Short'nin' bread; 
Paid six dollars for the skillet, 
Six dollars for the led, 
Spent six months in jail eatin' 
Short'nin' bread. 
Mama's little baby loves 
Short'nin', short'nin', 
Mama's little baby loves 
Short'nin' bread, 
Mama's little baby loves 
Short'nin', short'nin', 
Mama's little baby loves 
Short'nin' bread.
