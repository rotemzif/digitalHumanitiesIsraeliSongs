This car is cruising much too fast 
Dropping into hell now 
A crowd of people with no past
 They’ve seen their hero dead now 
 Been working Monday Tuesday Wednesday ‘ till morning comes
and through the weekend drinkin’ doin’ da doo ron ron
 In San Diego 
 Serving my time for something they know 
 Had to be done 
A life on death row
 My necklace rested on your neck 
Never was a fighter 
 Shooting made easy when you’re numb 
 I saw the noose was tightened 
 Was working Monday Tuesday Wednesday ‘till morning came 
 And through the weekend drinkin doing my walk of shame 
In San Diego
Ripping my time ‘cause something I sowed 
Wasn’t declined 
It’s time I let go 
 She was the crime,  I was the lie,  It was the perfect needle 
 We were doing so fine till the wave brought us down 
 In San Diego 
 Sinking in salty water I call your name 
 Hang on to that endless poem then start again 
 Yes it’s the sound of me preachin’ 
 It's the howl of you screamin’ 
 Burn your soul down 
 Tortured and drowned 
 My own true freak show 
 Serving my time  for something they know
 Had to be done 
 Its time I let go
She was the crime,  I was the lie,  It was the perfect needle 
 We were doing so fine till the wave brought us down 
In San Diego
