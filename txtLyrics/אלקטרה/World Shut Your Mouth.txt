She's flying in the face of fashion now 
She seems to have a will of her own 
She's flying in the face of fashion now 
She seems to have it all chromed 
The time was going so frequently 
She said if I try harder again 
She's flying in the face of fashion now 
She sells the world annually to a friend 
She sings, "World, shut your mouth, shut your mouth 
Put your head back in the clouds and shut your mouth 
World, shut your mouth, shut your mouth 
Put your head back in the clouds and shut your mouth" 
She always used to live so secretly 
She'd be seen in and out of the sound 
She's taking on the role of the four winds now 
She's having tea there out in the crowd 
She's flying in the face of fashion now 
She seems to have a will of her own 
In lieu of what you're saying so frequently 
She seems to have, it all adds up 
She sings, "World, shut your mouth, shut your mouth 
Put your head back in the clouds and shut your mouth 
World, shut your mouth, shut your mouth 
Put your head back in the clouds and shut your mouth" 
She sings, "World, shut your mouth, shut your mouth 
Put your head back in the clouds and shut your mouth 
World, shut your mouth, shut your mouth 
Put your head back in the clouds and shut your mouth" 
She sings, "World, shut your mouth, shut your mouth 
Put your head back in the clouds and shut your mouth 
World, shut your mouth, shut your mouth 
Put your head back in the clouds and shut your mouth" 
"World, shut your mouth, shut your mouth 
Put your head back in the clouds and shut your mouth 
World, shut your mouth, shut your mouth 
Put your head back in the clouds and shut your mouth"
