We've heard it all before 
We've learning to ignore 
You must confess this awful mess 
Isn't just a bore 
It's more than we could bear 
But you don't really care 
Kiss of live to save our life 
All you do is stare 
Sell yourself for cheap 
Make our mother weep 
Loosing pride is hard to hide 
And harder still to keep 
I'm back in full attack 
Never give in until they crack 
Emercency 
Raiders strike but where 
Panic in the air 
Running scared oh im so scared 
It gets you everywhere 
Heard it on the news 
Rebels get accused 
Fighting for another cause 
But why and where and whose 
Carry out their plan 
Release us if you can 
Whats your worth to a pile of earth 
Youre just another man 
Black jack wanna quack 
Never get your money back 
Pack attack in the back 
By a bloody maniac 
Better see industry 
Take it fast and make it last 
Go away make them pay 
Never make the same misstakes 
Sometimes care sometimes not 
See 'em bleed and see them rot
