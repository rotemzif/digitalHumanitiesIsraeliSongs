You don't own me, I'm not just one of your many toys 
You don't own me, don't say I can't go with other boys 
And don't tell me what to do 
And don't tell me what to say 
And please, when I go out with you 
Don't put me on display, 'cause 
You don't own me, don't try to change me in any way 
You don't own me, don't tie me down 'cause I'd never stay 
Oh, I don't tell you what to say 
I don't tell you what to do 
So just let me be myself 
That's all I ask of you 
I'm young and I love to be young 
I'm free and I love to be free 
To live my life the way I want 
To say and do whatever I please 
A-a-a-nd don't tell me what to do 
Oh-h-h-h don't tell me what to say 
And please, when I go out with you 
Don't put me on display 
I don't tell you what to say 
Oh-h-h-h don't tell you what to do 
So just let me be myself 
That's all I ask of you 
I'm young and I love to be young 
I'm free and I love to be free 
To live my life the way I want
