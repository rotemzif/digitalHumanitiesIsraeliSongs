The girl is crazy
,she jumps and makes a lot of noise
Just like a record, she spins around with all the boys.
The queen of drama, she's looking for a Special king.
She She needs love(ho damn! )Its just another fling. 
Now what she did last night will not make him stay.
She tries to make it right but makes it worse everyday. 
She needs a boyfriend, boyfriend.
Who'll understand?
Boyfriend, boyfriend. And not a one night stand.
Boyfriend, boyfriend .she needs a man.
She's looking for a boyfriend!
The perfect hottie is standing right across the room.
He getting closer and makes her heart go boom boom boom.
He's all she wonted but there is just one little thing.
On his hand "bling-bling" she missed his wedding ring.
Now what she did last night will not make him stay
She tries to make it right but makes it worse everyday.
She needs a boyfriend, boyfriend.
Who'll understand?
boyfriend, boyfriend. And not a one night stand.
boyfriend, boyfriend. She needs a man.
She's looking for a boyfriend!
They never dare for you, care for you
they're never there for you
just like a statue girl
see how they stare at you
she's looking for mister right, how could that be?
when instead of a BF she's making out with an FB
f.u.c.k. buddy - buddy
on her body everybody spins
in this crazy competition she never wins
it's not her boyfriend, her toyfriend
it's only her enjoy-friend
so don't you ask me why you always try,
but you never find a boyfriend 
You'll never find a boyfriend, these boys say you're the hot trend.
But disappear and break your hart.
You'll never find a boyfriend, there will be no happy end.
You will go right back to the start
She needs a boyfriend, boyfriend.
Who'll understand?
boyfriend, boyfriend. And not a one night stand.
boyfriend, boyfriend. She needs a man.
She's looking for a boyfriend!
