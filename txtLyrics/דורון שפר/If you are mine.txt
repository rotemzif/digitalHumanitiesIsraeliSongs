If you are mine
Well i'm the happiest guy
In the world
If you are mine
Just to be curld up
Between your small arms
Would really make
My soul shine
If you are mine
If you are mine
Well i'm blessed
Like no other man
If you are mine
I wouldn't need
To make any plans
For i'm free of it all
I'm hole with you
I'm just fine
If you are mine
You say that you are
With your eyes
believe me i've seen
Many lies
And i've been through
The valley of woe
All the sorrows
In every shape and size
And i believe in your toes Touching mine
How our dreams intertwine
If you are mine
Well i'm yours forever
If you are mine
It's a mirracle
We're still together
Not afraid any more
For you make
My soul shine
If you are mine
You say..
If you are mine
Well i'm the happiest guy
In the world
If you are mine
Just to be curld up
Between your small arms
Well thats the way
I'm designed
I'm hole with you
I'm just fine
For you make
My soul shine
If you are mine
