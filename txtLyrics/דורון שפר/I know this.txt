I don't know why
you love me like you do
I don't know why
or if what you say is true
but i know this
in your kiss
i'm alive
I don't know how
you got inside my skin
I don't know how
or what lies within
but i know this
in your kiss
i'm alive
I don't know where
you and I will be
I don't know where
will end our fantasy
but i know this
in your kiss
i'll survive
