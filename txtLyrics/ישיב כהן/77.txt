Soon to be broken
Never chosen our demise
Soon to be broken
I could see it in your eyes
Fate overpowered
Broken buds in our yard
Dreaded the hour
Once a friend now a scar
Seventy seven
Arrows splitting us apart
Seventy seven
On the doorbell to your heart
Cruel autumn showers
Fizzy water gone flat
Kisses turn sour
No more arrows to cast
Do you wanna fight donâ€™t you wanna fight?
My fists are in tow
On the great divide swallowing my pride
It was all just for show
Soon to reopen
A true emotion to be dared
Sweet foggy notion
I can feel it
