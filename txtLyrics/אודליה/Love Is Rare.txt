We don’t know what we want 
But we know we can find that love 
Faith is all we need to get around 
Believe i&i gonna take you high 
If you only listen 
You hear the man who keeps silent 
Come open up your heart, and not your mind
Cause otherwise you will stay blind to see, 
The true reality... 
Much more difficult to keep silent 
Than to keep on talking and talking 
In our loud society 
Where everything is so provoking yea 
Love is rare 
Cause we're afraid to dare 
Step by step we're getting there 
If we keep an i&i and stay aware 
Still we don’t know what we want 
But we know we can find that love 
Faith is all we need to get around 
Believe i&i gonna take you high 
If you only listen 
You hear the man who keeps silent 
Come open up your heart and not your mind 
Cause otherwise, you will stay blind to see 
The true reality 
See in these so stressful days 
We have to keep the fire ablaze 
Although ambitions buried under pressures 
We're social animals inna the race 
So mysterious jah ways 
Love is rare 
Cause we're afraid to dare 
Step by step we're getting there
