Soft skin against my face, soft 
With a scent of kindness 
Give me, 
Give me a smile 
Sweetness of milk in my hair, tangled 
With a scent of madness 
Give me, 
Give me some sleep 
My eyes are shut 
A minute passed 
His face appears from darkness 
Now running down the long long hall 
I cannot go much faster 
He's running from my love cliché 
Of family and laughter 
I follow to the edge 
Look back 
It's ever after 
A cry breaks the night 
I Jump, I Run 
Why won't you give me 
Give me some time 
My eyes are shut 
A minute passed 
My face is freed from sadness 
Now running out the long long hall 
I'm soaring free with laughter 
I'm running from my love cliché 
The heart is pounding faster 
I'm almost there, right near the edge 
Look back 
It's ever after 
Soft skin against my face 
Melting my fears with kindness 
Soft, 
Tangled hair, 
Sore pain, 
Give me a smile
