How could you say that I didnâ€™t love you
When all I did was give you my heart
How many times do I have to show you
Before you know 
I'm ready tonight
I will never give up 
I'll never give
I will never give up
I'll never give
I will never give up the fairy tale
Yalla Yalla
I'm in love
Yalla Yalla
Arabic delight 
Like the stories from one thousand and one nights
Oh baby I am ready
Yalla Yalla
If you won't believe all the words I tell you
One touch will make it all right
I'm not the same girl since I met you
Let's dance, it's an Arabic night
