Oh your kisses will always remind me  
Of things that I miss in you
And I'm tired of listening to signals 
They just me blue
Oh while you were loving me
I had someone near
Oh now that you're leaving me
I will always be
Oh lonely
So lonely
And now that you've found a friend
You are loosing me
I hear that you've found a friend
And she looks like me
All your kisses were endless they made me forget what I wanted to
I'll be looking for answers forever for some kind of clue
Oh love me
Oh love me
Oh love me
Oh love me
Oh love me
Oh love me
Oh love me
Oh love
Oh love me
