More or less I'm kinda lost, I'm
Going in and out in circles
And again I'm waiting on a change
More or less I'm in the corner
Comfortless and on the border
Simply missing something that was in you
Was it love? Was it a game?
I don't really know the meaning
But it felt a lot like happiness
Walking through the avenue
It's all relatively new
I guess its over for us more or less
More or less
I sort of liked it
You were my boy, the one I trusted
Anyway, looks like I lost it
Yeah
More or less
I sort of liked it
To be your girl, the one you wanted
Yeah yeah yeah
Now I'm in a different place, I
Needed not to see the faces
Of the people that I call my friends
More or less I'm happier but
Very unpredictable, I'm
quickly caving in when things get rough
Was it love? Was it a game?
Tell me dear, am I insane?
Oh, did you know how low
You made me feel? 
Walking through the avenue
It's all relatively new
I guess it's over for us more or less  
More or less
I sort of liked it
You were my boy, the one I trusted
I didn't love you but I liked it
Yeah
More or less
I sort of liked it
To be your girl, the one you wanted
Yeah yeah yeah
