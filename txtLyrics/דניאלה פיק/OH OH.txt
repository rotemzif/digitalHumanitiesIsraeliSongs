I used to stare 
Late at night when the light was dark as ever 
It was ok 
To believe in love that lasts forever 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Are you gonna love me like the love in all the fairy tales before 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Are you gonna love me like the love in all the fairy tales 
Baby 
Baby 
Baby 
I lay awake 
I don’t care if there are girls around you 
Don’t try to fake 
Cause I know they don’t mean more to you than I do 
One love 
Give me one love 
Give me all your body 
One love 
Give me one love 
I don’t want nobody 
Just say something 
Don’t try to lie about you feeling 
The same something 
Now all the nights are gonna be so cold 
Time passes fast 
Now at last I can ask you to be my lover 
Be mine, confess 
If you rescue me now maybe it's not over 
I want one love love, baby 
I want one love love 
I want one love love, baby 
Baby
