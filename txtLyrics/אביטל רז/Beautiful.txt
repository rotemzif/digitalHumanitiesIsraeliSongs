Another one left me this Friday evening 
I waved goodbye and thought, 
Here's another skull for Kali's garland. 
She stands on the heart of her lover 
I wear my heart on my sleeve. 
All this sweat 
All these tears 
All this falling in love, falling from grace 
At least occasionally I get a song out of it 
Maybe one day I'll make some money� 
God, give me a heart to stand on 
God, make my feet stop faltering 
God, give me a heart that can take my weight. 
He lies in her path and he stops her from destroying everything 
He stares up at his black beloved in ecstasy. 
Another one left me this Friday evening 
I waved goodbye and thought, 
Here's another skull for Kali's garland. 
She stands on the heart of her lover 
I wear my heart on my sleeve. 
All this sperm 
All this blood 
All this falling in love, falling from grace 
At least occasionally I get a song out of it 
Maybe one day I'll make some money� 
I am black 
I am beautiful (daughters of Jerusalem) 
By now I am black and blue 
Black and blue, (what to do?), and beautiful
