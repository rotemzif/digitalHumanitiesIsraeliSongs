Unknown angry female rock star blares out from my radio
And me- all I want to do is make you breakfast,
as you say your morning prayers, I want to make you breakfast.
You say you've reached your limit now and anger's on it's way.
You're tired of my harshness, of my fickled mind, but darling,
You make me wanna be so sweet.
I don't need to compete, I don't need to defeat you.
She's getting angrier and angrier on my radio.
She's been used, she's been fucked, she's been cheated on and thrown away.
Now she knows how the story goes she's not so innocent.
Maybe this time we can avoid all thatâ€¦
Maybe you and me can avoid all that bloody mess this time.
We're not so young anymore.
We've let our souls get tainted in this world.
Sometimes I feel like I've been to hell and fought my way back,
Now I'm not afraid anymore.
Let's be innocent
Let's be innocent
Let's be innocent
Let's be!
I need you to come inside me and turn on the light.
Some places in me they're still darker than the darkest night.
