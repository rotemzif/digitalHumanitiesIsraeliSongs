May I love you to death 
May I love you so much, you'll just melt away 
May I be your father and your mother 
May I come to you whenever you call me 
May you never forget me 
May you never want to be apart 
May I fill you, make you so happy 
you'll never turn away 
May you sing only to me 
May I be the object of all your longing 
give to me your body, I'll make it my own 
I'll fill it with delight 
give me all your thoughts, give me all your feelings 
trust me, trust me, trust me, have no fear
