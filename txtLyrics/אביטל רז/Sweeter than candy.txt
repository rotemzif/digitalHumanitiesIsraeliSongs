I'm in Frankfurt airport, this is my fourth country in ten days,
I made a rash decision 
Now I'm going through my things passing the time
About to do the stupidest thing I've ever done,
I say this retrospectively…
Inside crumpled plastic:
Eleven pictures of  Indian Gods, multi colored
Photographs of old lovers
A plastic card releasing me from the army
My secret number for the cash machine
Some blue bird's feather
Yellow vaccination card
An illustrated prayer book to Shiva
Bad passport photos
Postcards that were never sent
Drawings by my half sisters
A tear stained envelope with the address of someone that doesn't live there anymore
A photo of me with a dog that died
A photocopy of a passport I washed and dried and paid a fine.
Fines and regrets and prayers 
I feel so lonely and alive...
And my butterfly sticker from before my heart was ever broken
It shines so sweetly 
It has no story to tell
I'm still waiting, Oh God, for the place to stick it
I thought I followed love
But love didn't follow me
He followed another…
I feel so lonely and so free
Ah, sweeter than candy
I need sweeter than candy
