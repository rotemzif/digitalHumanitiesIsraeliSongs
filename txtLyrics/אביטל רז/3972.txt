There are sick little bubbles in my head
There are sick little bubbles in my head, again.
Sick little bubbles that are boiling
Sick little bubbles that are boiling
Their steam comes out from my mouth
Comes out in form of words:
I love you
I love you
I love you
#3972
I'm waiting for you
I'm hating for you
I'm crying for you
I'm dying for you
#3972
There are pretty little bubbles in my head
There are pretty little bubbles in my head, again.
Pretty little bubbles that are boiling
Pretty little bubbles that are boiling
Their steam comes out  from my mouth
Comes out in form of words:
I love you
I love you
I love you
#3972
And if it can't work out this time
It won't be for any fault of mine, no.
And if it can't be you and me
Then I'll fall in love 
With 3973.
I'm waiting for you
I'm hating for you
I'm crying for you
I'm dying for you
Be my lucky number
