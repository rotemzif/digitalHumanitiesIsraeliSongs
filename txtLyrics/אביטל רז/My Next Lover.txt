My next lover will be a butcher
He will have big strong hands
He'll honor his trade
Be gentle and kind
(When kindness and gentleness are due...)
And he'll do the killing fast
While thinking of other things
My next lover will have a loud warm laugh and a deep slow voice
And he'll give me, give me delight
We will not no hunger 
My lover and I
I'll sleep so peacefully under soft feathers till the day I die
