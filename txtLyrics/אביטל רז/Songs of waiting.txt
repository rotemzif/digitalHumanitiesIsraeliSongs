How can I sing to you my loveless lover?
I'll change your name.
How can I sing to you my loveless lover?
I'll sing of pain.
Songs of pain and of waiting...
Waiting to sing to you again.
Like a snake that sheds his skin,
I'll shed these songs I'll shed my sins,
I'll slither on without tattoos, 
without these pains I pained for you.
