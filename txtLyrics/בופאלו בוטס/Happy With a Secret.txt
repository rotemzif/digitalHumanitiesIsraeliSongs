Stop being so troubled about tomorrow 
Let this cool breeze take all you emptiness and sorrow 
Open your eyes 
Hang on to your lucky star 
Try to count to ten and let this day go by 
Don't let anyone make you a servant 
You can have anything you want because you deserve it 
Open your arms 
Try to catch a falling star 
Happy with a secret different with a smile 
When you're up 
You're like a goddess 
When you're down 
Hell upon earth 
When you change it changes everything 
Stop being so troubled about tomorrow...
