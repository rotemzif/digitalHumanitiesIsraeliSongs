As you hang yourself behind this door 
Horses gallop 
On your wooden floor 
Staring at these concrete walls 
I can't remember the last time 
I've roamed such a narrow hall 
You say I always understand 
Your morbid thoughts 
Your fragile lands 
Staring at these concrete walls 
I can't remember the last time 
I've loved such a narrow hall 
Plastic chairs and broken knees 
Your insanity versus my disease 
It's the perfect night to kill it 
The perfect night to make it stop 
Battleship fingers into my skin 
Your knuckles are bleeding 
You ask me to lean 
Staring at these concrete walls 
I can't remember the last time 
I've escaped such a narrow hall 
Plastic chairs and broken knees 
Your insanity versus my disease 
It's the perfect night to kill it 
The perfect night to make it stop 
I've run too far I've broken my pledge 
I'm sorry my love you were never mine to save
