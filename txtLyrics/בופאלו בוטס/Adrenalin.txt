I've tried this before and now 
I want more and more and more 
I want more of it 
Just a hit 
It's irresistible 
So tense it's raising hell 
I'll try it again I wish it 
Never ever ever ends 
So fucking easy now 
Don't know how 
It's running through my veins 
Like a million humming trains 
I've tried this before and now...
