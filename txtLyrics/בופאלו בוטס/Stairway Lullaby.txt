Come to me now 
Like a broken whale 
A piano that's so out of tune 
Come to me now 
For what it's worth 
Always so rusty never a boon 
Come to me now 
These pills aren't enough 
To peel your existence off of my spine 
Come to me now 
And don't say a word 
I know I've committed the biggest of crimes 
Sing me a song 
For I've had enough 
Of this world 
Of this life Of this head 
Pinatas and dancers 
Will wait at the door 
As I slowly drug into rest 
Come to me now 
My sick little boy 
With a molded old knife in your chest 
Sing me a song 
For I've had enough 
Of this world 
Of this life Of this head 
Sing me to sleep 
As you take off my shirt 
And slowly drag me to bed
