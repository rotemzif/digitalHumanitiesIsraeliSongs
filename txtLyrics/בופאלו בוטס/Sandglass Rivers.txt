Rivers of whisky Smokey cold air 
The moon is bleeding out 
These words that we share 
Your arms full of tattoos 
And I don’t belong 
To your road that has faded 
After staring at the sun too long 
Years pass us by 
Like blood dried under my fingernails 
And time is like a mad accordion 
Ticking away in a terrible note 
Ill throw you a life belt 
You’ll live through this tide 
You’ve done nothing wrong 
No reason to hide 
We’ll die in the morning 
Our hair like a storm 
Shoes that don’t fit 
No place to call home 
Years pass us by...
