Twenty three buildings 
and no way out of this town 
streets are full of fog 
nobody’s slowing down 
I never asked for this parade 
Bookies, whores and clowns 
Erase my name from your windshield 
And catch me when I fall 
A hope that dies Following a 
silent highway that never lies...
Paper planes are crashing 
With every dream that turns to clay 
A script that’s re-written 
When nobody cares to stay 
I write my nightmares on the wall 
For you to read in the morning 
Let the wind peel off my lineaments 
And just keep on going 
A hope that...
