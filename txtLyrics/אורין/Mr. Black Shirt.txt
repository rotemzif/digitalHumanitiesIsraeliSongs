Hi
He's the boss, he will control you from now on
He's the reason why you were born.               
I'm just joking, he's the best, that is why I'm hoping to go so fast
Smile smile smile on my face
While we're talking, it is fake
Smile smile smile on my face
While we're talking, so fake.  
I hate you with all my heart
I'm leaving this jail happy. 
I`ll never forget you for who you are
And how hard you tried to change me
Welcome to the circle of silence
Everything here is a secret
Happiness is granted
So play along play along, or else you will get burn
Play along play along
Play play play alone
Mr. Black shirt how do you feel when you scream
Tell me now
Mr. Black shirt how do you feel when you scream
Tell me now
Suddenly my eyes are opened
