Time is passing by
and I am moving slow
Like to move my feet
but I know just what know
No one will be saving me
from this empty road
Try to be the best I can
for you my love
Maybe I will start again
Breathe and dream again
Melting clocks are ticking loud
Telling me to run, run fast
Try to be the try to be the best I can be
Time is passing by
Sealed eyes smiling back
Old pictures in my head
Controlling every step I make
People I have loved before today are a pile of dust
Faces not clear, a blur
Forgotten in the past
Maybe I will start again
Breathe and dream again
Melting clocks are ticking loud
Telling me to run, run fast
Try to be the try to be the best I can be
Try to be the best I can be
