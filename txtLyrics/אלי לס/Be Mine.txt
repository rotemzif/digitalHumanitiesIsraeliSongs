And when the night's falling 
Dogs are barking 
Trees are hanging low 
She's gone and I'm relieved 
Just another poorly chosen bone 
Back to the guitar 
Random clich√©s on the smooth bright neck 
Of a feminine substitute 
There's an only feeling 
Nothing left to fake 
Be mine in speed notes 
And far away roads 
I want to be naked all of the time 
Nothing but sandals 
They were yours 
Back then I felt like they're mine 
Without position it feels like you own your fate 
But the minute you're out again 
You're brain is struggling 
Too late 
It's flooded with junk 
Be mine in speed notes 
And far away roads
