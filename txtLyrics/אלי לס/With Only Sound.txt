You know 
With only sound 
You can get away 
You know 
With only sound 
You can get away 
See the reasons, not the fears 
To talk about with a friend 
Driving ferry 
February rain 
The good old band 
The end 
You know 
That again a child 
You will never be 
You know 
If you'll find the one 
Who will set you free 
Later on you'll sit alone 
Staring at the tiles 
Think of how it's good to know 
We still have many miles 
To go away 
Leaving without anything left to say
