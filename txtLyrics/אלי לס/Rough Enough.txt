Took me awhile but I made the step of the attack 
And it ends like a failure 
And all I wanted was a free access to a 
beautiful face of the girl That will stay 
A rough enough part of my day 
Morning in my cans and bottles garden 
Nature's bright 
Can this sunlight tan tour skin 
All the way to the unseen 
Say your name 
Stop the game 
Cause you're away 
Will you stay 
A rough enough part of my day
