Life's been here around 
without pressure 
When it comes to drop 
I do it better 
When I hear a song 
I want to rock 
It's better to rechoose 
Let's skip the talk 
When I see a bird I wear my hat 
When it's getting dark I don't mind that 
When I see a field I think of dude 
When I lose something I think of you
