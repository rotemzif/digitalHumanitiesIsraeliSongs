I gave it all I got 
I fought back for my heart
Today will be  
Tomorrow's blues  
Still hadn't call you X
But we're here for sex
In curse 
We had it real good
A bandage made of booze
We kiss away the bruise 
That use to leave us crumble 
And with a swinging shot 
I toss away my plot 
And in your arms I stumble 
I lied when I told you life goes on  
My cry was lost in sweat beneath our clothes 
How it's so damn easy for boy?
And my stare's deaf to the rhythm of your touch
As i let this love go 
And some of you that's dead 
If you laid off the meds 
Could be what i would fight for        
On a taste of sin 
A sweet and awful sting 
On a bet
I sold myself short  
When you're gone with the day 
Regret will stay 
And hold me till i swear
No, no more
The night fading it's blue
Oh don't you steel it too 
For old crimes lover
