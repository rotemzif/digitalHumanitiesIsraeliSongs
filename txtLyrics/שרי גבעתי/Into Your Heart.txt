There’s nothing left 
And we all know it 
But children don’t think 
They just naturally function and love 
Here we are, seems unfair 
An eye for an eye until all of our world is now blind
Straight through your arms 
Straight through your arms 
Into your heart 
Into your heart
There’s no way out 
Bring in the villains 
And we’ll never stop, 
cause we fight
even when there’s no cause 
Its in our veins, I can feel it 
When everything’s perfect 
I’ll purposely fumble the ball
Straight through your arms 
Straight through your arms 
Into your heart 
Into your heart
Talk is cheap for now 
Fly me away where the children laugh 
Hearts never fake
There is no way 
I’m going back 
These monkeys are here 
and they’re scratching the skin off my back 
Figure out what to do 
When time’s running out 
And our future is clear out of view
Straight through your arms 
Straight through your arms 
Into your heart 
Into your heart
