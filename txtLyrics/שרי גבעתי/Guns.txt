Hey, show’s pretty nice 
They wanna hear more 
They need to think twice 
(so) You’re wrapping your soul 
Start cleaning up
You’re killing a joke 
With your bitter lough
Hey, time to go home 
One to forget 
One for the road 
No ticking clocks 
Bare, out of touch 
The opening chord 
For my wounded match
You’ll have my guns 
You’ll take me down 
You’ll see though the flashing haze 
You’ll hold me down,
to see through my painted face 
You’ll stay around
Hey, it’s all in your head 
Falling in love Falling in hate 
Cause you only chose 
From what you could get 
Your life is a show
And the star’s nearly dead
You’ll have my guns 
You’ll take me down 
You’ll see though the flashing haze 
You’ll hold me down,
to see through my painted face 
You’ll stay around
I’m gonna fight it 
And you’ll keep me close 
Till i’m falling, tired 
Bloodstains will glow 
To the shine of gunpowder 
Cause you’ll stay around.. Around...
