Easy come, easy go 
That's just how you live, oh 
Take, take, take it all 
But you never give 
Should've known you was trouble 
From the first kiss 
Had your eyes wide open 
Why were they open? 
Gave you all I had 
And you tossed it in the trash 
You tossed it in the trash, you did 
To give me all your love 
Is all I ever asked 
Cause what you don't understand is 
I'd catch a grenade for you 
Throw my hand on the blade for you 
I'd jump in front of a train for you 
You know I'd do anything for you (yeah, yeah) 
I would go through all this pain 
Take a bullet straight through my brain 
Yes, I would die for you, baby 
But you won't do the same 
Black, black, black and blue 
Beat me 'til I'm numb 
Tell the devil I said "Hey" when you get back to where you're from 
Bad man, bad man 
That's just what you are 
Yeah, you smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car 
Gave you all I had 
And you tossed it in the trash 
You tossed it in the trash, yes you did 
To give me all your love 
Is all I ever asked 
Cause what you don't understand is 
I'd catch a grenade for you 
Throw my hand on the blade for you
I'd jump in front of a train for you 
You know I'd do anything for you (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
I would go through all this pain 
Take a bullet straight through my brain 
Yes, I would die for you, baby 
But you won't do the same 
If my body was on fire 
You would watch me burn down in flames 
You said you loved me, you're a liar 
Cause you never ever ever did, baby 
But, I'd still catch a grenade for you 
Throw my hand on the blade for you 
I'd jump in front of a train for you 
You know I'd do anything for you 
I would go through all this pain 
Take a bullet straight through my brain 
Yes I would die for you baby 
But you won't do the same
