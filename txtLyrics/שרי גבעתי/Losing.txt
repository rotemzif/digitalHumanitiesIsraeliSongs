You pulled my head above the water 
And every breath it almost feels like change 
When trouble’s waiting on the corner 
No use in telling you that’ll be there
I’m losing i’m losing you, now 
I’m losing i’m losing me
You see yourself when you look through me 
Wish you could live the stories that you tell 
Don’t say i’m standing when you hold me 
Just come on down here,
you won’t know you’r way
I’m losing i’m losing you, now 
I’m losing i’m losing me
I never said you couldn’t stay here 
It just ain’t right to ask you to 
And I hear you babe, you wanna save me
But who will be there to save you?
I’m losing i’m losing you, now 
I’m losing i’m losing me.
