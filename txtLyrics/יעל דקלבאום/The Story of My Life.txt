The story of my life begins 
Billions & billions of years ago 
The madness and the strife took place 
Probably before I can even remember
Ever since I entered the circle of life
l feel as if I'm just a porn in somebody else's game
So l set out to find the hidden light 
That got blocked behind these thick clouds 
of an endless december
I thought I could break the chains
l thought l could be free
The love that I had found long ago
Got berried underneath the snow
One step too far along the cracking ice
And he disappeared into another dimension
So I jumped upon the dragon's wings 
And he flew me into a space of infinity 
And we went to see the lord of the sun 
To see if he could melt the ice
and bring my love back to me
Hoping he could break the chains
Hoping he could be free
One day we might find the lain 
Leading straight to the peak
And the hands of the angels won't let go 
so we'll safely fly far above the sea
