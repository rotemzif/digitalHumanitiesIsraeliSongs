Sky is at my feet
The clouds are sinking low into the streets 
And all the birds are crawling 
And everything I know is gone
It's fading into gray
The angels have not one more word to say
The lights are dimming 
And everything I know is gone
So keep your child 
Running wild
It's just how it's meant to be
