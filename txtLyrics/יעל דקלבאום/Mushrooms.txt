I have become so unbelievably 
Alive since what you've done to me
The rain is gone now 
Still the wind blows
I'm the mushrooms
You're the rainbow
Run to the water......
I have become so unbelievably 
Alive since what you've done to me
The rain is gone now 
Still the wind blows
Looking up through the water's flow
Run to the water down by the hills
Drink all you can till you're belly is filled
Shape me break me I'm at your command 
You'll be the water I'll be the sand
I have become so unbelievably 
Alive since what you've done to me
