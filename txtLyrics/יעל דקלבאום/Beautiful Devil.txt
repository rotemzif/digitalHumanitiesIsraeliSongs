You beautiful devil
You limitless rebel
Arestless aveger
On an endless adventure
You passed through my world with your nuclear weapon
Shaking my entire existence i a second
You shut your iron doors in my face
But mind were left wide open to my powers and grace
You said you'd give me an ocean of love to dive into
A bed on the mountains above to climb into
Now I found within me that very same place I admired in you
So please let me rephrase
I'm beautiful devil
I'm limitless rebel
Arestless aveger
On an endless adventure
