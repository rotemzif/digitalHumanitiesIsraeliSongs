Under solid ground
non a sound is heard My eyes are
wide open Yet can't see a
thing Only with the dark come the
sparks That lead my way to the
hand Pulling at my strings
Cracks in the ground open wide
Take a little trip into a dream
Deep in the cellar she hides
Wish she'd never found me
I'm so sorry I didn't come before
I was looking for beauty 
In planets of the sun 
But I'm here tonight
looking at your face
if not for my continenceI
would try to run
No one will cry when you die
Take my little boat down to the sea
Under the waves I will hide
You can never find me
Washed into the arms of 
the shore The sand
is keeping me warmI sleep safe and sound
