So in the magic love you can't believe
If good vibes are true 
than why do they leave
Every thing is under the spot light of the sun
There is enough of her light for every one
put you're trust in the wind and you'll find it 
Don't let your emotions blind it
Even when you look down you'll 
see there is ground

1nk0qe0qmco0vgpqtkju11member a man sitting under a tree
Waiting for someone to come set him free
There must be a truth that is stronger than it all
Nothing to hold on to and no were to fall
put you're trust in the wind and you'll find it
Don't let your emotions blind it 
You can try to look high 
you'll there is sky
1nk0qe0qmco0vgpqtkju11And jumping back up
