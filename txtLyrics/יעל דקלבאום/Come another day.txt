Come another day I'll be ready
Come another day to free me
After time will pass and wounds will heal
Then I'll do it right
Come another day I'll be ready
Come another wave to free me
When I know that time is at its peak
Then I'll do it right
Now the worlds awake and I'm asleep
Every thing seems so fake to me
When I find a place I know is real
I'm sure to do it right
I know there's a time for me
Waiting past that door
All I have to do is let me go
So come another day I'll be ready
Come another day to see me
After time will pass and wounds will heal
I'm sure to do it right
I know there's a time for me
Waiting past that door
All I have to do is let me go
