We all
follow what we need
Eating
everything that helps us grow out
of our seed
some times we grow
some times we shrink
Some times
we get to feel so high and then we
sink
So she reached the world
of possibilities
So unaware of
It's abilities 
And the feeling
grew stronger at each and every
door
Till poor Alice forgot what
she was living for
Alice went
on a holiday
To a place so far
away
She fell through a hole so
dark and gray
And didn't know if
she would have to stay
Alice went
on a children's holiday
She got
lost in her confusion 
Not
knowing her reality withe her
illusions
And between all of the
mushrooms to the queen of
hearts
She'd wished she'd never
gotten to the point were this
cursed journey starts
Alice
went on a holiday
To a place so
far away
She fell through a hole
so dark and gray
And didn't know
if she would have to stay
Alice
went on a children's holiday
