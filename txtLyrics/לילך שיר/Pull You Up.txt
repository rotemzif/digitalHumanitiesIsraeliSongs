You are my symphony of light" he said 
"In my dreams I always hoped I'd find my soul mate 
Let's take the road less traveled 
into this strange old love affair 
Or better yet – 
Come rest your head with me" 
He said before he left that day 
Hold my hand, oh, no, don't leave me 
No, don't…please grab my 
wrist and I will pull you up 
Be my shelter, don't slip away 
I'll make it better, I promise 
He took her places she'd never dreamt before 
They always were each others' light 
, they didn't fight Everything was alright 
But he carried things he'd burried 
long long time ago 
They started creepin' down below 
"I love you so!" he said, then climbed on the window 
Hold my hand, oh, no, don't leave me... 
He was her lover, she wanted no other, 
She looked-up to him and he was 
her guiding light 
She believed him, she never deceived him 
But she couldn't keep him alive
