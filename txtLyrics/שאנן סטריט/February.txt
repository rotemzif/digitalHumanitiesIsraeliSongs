something’s gonna drag me down soon- that's clear
a memory of some sort a child's tear
something’s gonna drag me down before too long
maybe a photo, i don't know, maybe this song
february can be real brutal
but this year we're getting lots of sunny days
life has its way of pampering you sometimes
in meaningless n' stupid n' pathetic sort of ways
i’ve had some newfound creativity flowing through me
a buzz of opinions and ideas gushing through me
most days n' most nights are a lot less gloomy
it’s like i look at myself and i see a new me
well maybe 'new' isn't exactly what i mean
because it's more like i feel that what i’m actually seeing
is a freer me an easier me not a bitter me a sweeter me
the kind of me i could have been if this wouldn't have happened or if
my heart was tin
but then again in the back of my head
i know this can't last there’s a giant slope ahead
it’s all a matter of when i begin the descent
to the depths that no one can mend
something’s gonna drag me down soon- that's clear
a memory of some sort a child's tear
something’s gonna drag me down before too long
maybe a photo, i don't know, maybe this song, maybe this song
going to a party later tonight
don’t really want to but i should be polite
to the people who invited me- friends of mine
sometimes i have pictures of them in my mind
at your funeral all red eyed n' teary
tonight their gonna be all chit chat n' cheery
at your funeral with stubble n' a trembling bottom lip
tonight at the party they'll all attempt to look hip
hop around, maybe dance a little
have a drink eye a woman and advance a little
do just what i would have done once upon a time
before the mutant cell you were hosting committed its crime
before it picked you in your prime- but that's enough!
please! please no more of this stuff!
these thoughts and myself just like bonnie n' clyde
the party's starting i better get ready so i don't miss my ride
something’s gonna drag me down soon- that's clear
a memory of some sort a child's tear
something’s gonna drag me down before too long
maybe a photo, i don't know, maybe this...
something’s gonna drag me down soon that's clear
a menu a street sign a child's tear
something’s gonna drag me down before too long
maybe this party tonight who knows... maybe this song, probably this song.
