I can't hold on, whats gone is gone 
and whts here is near to nothing 
I know I can, but I don't want to 
I just miss the lips I used to kiss 
do you love him? 
if what you want is what you gettin 
wel no one knows whats good for you 
I'm looking out for some one new 
but I gues I'm not as quick as you 
do you love him? 
I want to hold you tight 
I want to hold you tight 
I'd love to spend the night and hold 
you tight and smel you 
it's the best smell in the world 
you pulled me out of somthing bad 
and you took me some where good
