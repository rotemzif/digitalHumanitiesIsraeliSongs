I`ll lead a simple life
I won`t bother anyone
A penny here is a bucketful
Where I left my mind
 I struggle through my day
I try to hide my pain
Waiting for a time where
Iâ€™ll be back into your arms
We`ve been together but very much apart
I was never strong like you are
The things we have to do to survive
Lock away our dreams put love aside
I wish i didn`t have to walk away
I wish we didn`t have to live this way
I`ll lead a lonely life
I won`t ask for much
The price we pay is much to high
And it never stops
I stay awake at night
I need you by my side
The years are passing
I`m afraid my love won`t be enough
We`ve been together but very much apart
I was never strong like you are
The things we have to do to survive
Lock away our dreams put love aside
I wish i didn`t have to walk away
I wish we didn`t have to live this way
