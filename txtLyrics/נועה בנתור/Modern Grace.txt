In this day another grace - 
you know 
That all the pieces are in place, 
Tied in strings of happiness 
Look, the seasons have turned grey, They take you far away 
All the world is filled with modern grace – say grace 
You see the writing on the wall – you know 
Inhibitions start to fall - 
turning dust and grain to gold 
Suddenly you feel the weight dissolve inside 
Modern grace you take me on and on and on 
I don’t want to be away from you 
Modern grace you take me on and on and on 
I want to be away with you 
I don’t mind this empty space – I know 
You smile and offer me the way, Building bow and turn to snow 
Look, the seasons have turned grey, They take you far away 
All the world is filled with modern grace – say grace 
I love you more today than ever… 
I love you more each day
