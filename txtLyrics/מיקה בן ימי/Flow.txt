I don't want to be with you
You think I'll fall into your arms 
and treat you like you want me to 
I want you to shut your mouth 
My head hurts you're talking too much
I don't want this kind of guy
He may be hot but he won’t make me fly  
I need someone to take all control
So I said-
Hey, this is how things go 
My life's a comedy
You’ve got no chance to keep up with me 
So I will never flow
No, no, no, no!
I don't want to be with you
You think I'll fall into your arms 
and then feel the way you do 
I want you to shut your mouth 
My head hurts you're trying to hard
I don't want this kind of guy
He may be smart but he won’t make me cry  
I need someone to take all control
So I say-
Hey, this is how things go 
My life's a comedy
You’ve got no chance to keep up with me 
and I will never flow
No, no, no, no!
