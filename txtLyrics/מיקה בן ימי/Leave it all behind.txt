Finally I can say it's over
The doves are free to fly
My wings are starting to get older
And stronger at the same time
Opened a door that was locked for ages 
Old pieces I have found
You're gone and your picture makes no difference 
Leave it all behind 
I don't care if you're lost without me
I don't care if you’re doing fine
I don't care what you feel about me
Leave it all behind
I can smile and now that I'm sober
The day seems so bright
The moon is sitting on my shoulder 
Leave it all behind
He tells me to leave it all behind
I don't care if you're lost without me
I don't care if you’re doing fine
I don't care what you feel about me
Leave it all behind
I don’t need to hide
I don't need your guidance  
Towards my feelings
I don’t need your love
I just need to listen to what I'm thinking
I don’t need to hide
I don’t need you  
Finally I can say it's over
Had the worst time of my life
I've learned and now that I'm sober
I can leave it all behind
