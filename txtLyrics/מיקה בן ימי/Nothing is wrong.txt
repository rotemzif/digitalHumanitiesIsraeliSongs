Don't you cry, don't be shy,
stand up straight, here it comes
Say goodbye, don't you cry,
hold yourself, don't forget -
You are strong, move along,
nothing's wrong of feeling alone
Heal your mind, heal your soul,
kiss goodbye, don't you fall
Love yourself, no regrets,
donâ€™t you cry, don't forget -
You are strong, move along,
nothing is wrong
Every morning I say these words
To cope and clean all my thoughts
It works
I laugh I sing I do my thing
A bird with non illegal sin
It works
Love yourself, live yourself,
watch yourself, tease yourself
Here it comes, here it goes,
do survive, don't you fall
Think about now and not about tomorrow
Nothing is wrong
Every morning I say these words
To cope and clean all my thoughts
It works
I laugh I sing I do my thing
A bird with non illegal scene
It works
