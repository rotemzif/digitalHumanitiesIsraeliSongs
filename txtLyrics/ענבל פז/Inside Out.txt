I’ve been pushed and pulled, left behind 
and I’m tired of people telling me 
the only way... is their way 
what if I decided just to change my mind 
take a seed and plant it 
for a better day 
I’m growing my whole world 
From the inside out 
I believe in my dream 
There ain’t no doubt 
Like a flower I’m gonna bloom 
Whatever I ’ve got to do 
I can turn my whole world around 
From the inside out 
Go ahead say I’m a silly girl 
but I’ve seen roses find they’re way 
Towards the sun, and I am one 
A sidewalk crack is no match for a flower or a seed 
That wants to free 
Chorus: 
I’m growing my whole world 
From the inside out 
I believe in my dream 
there ain’t no doubt 
like a flower I’m gonna bloom 
whatever I ’ve got to do 
I can turn my whole world around 
From the inside out 
Bridge: 
So many lies I’ve 
Mistaken for the truth 
When all along the skies were clear 
The answer is right here 
Chorus 
I’m growing my whole world 
from the inside out 
I believe in my dream 
There ain’t no doubt 
Like a flower I’m gonna bloom 
Whatever I’ve got to do 
I can turn my whole world around 
From the inside out
