I’m scared to live 
But afraid to die 
I can feel how fragile life is right now 
All I know is I got to try 
I don’t want to be unaware 
But frightened to know 
What my future holds 
All I know is I got to try 
Chorus: 
Night will come 
but the morning isn’t far away 
the sun will come out... again 
rain will fall 
like my tears the rain won’t stay 
the sun will come out again 
I’m afraid to love 
But afraid to be alone 
I’m scared to let go 
All I know is I’m allowed to cry
