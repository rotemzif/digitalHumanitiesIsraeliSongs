I’m 10 years old, I got my favorite record on 
you open my door and listen to me sing a while you say 
"I’ll help you rise I’ll set you free 
you can be anything you want to be" 
but now I feel lost, without you here I’m... lost 
Chorus: 
I’ll rise from the ashes I will thrive 
I will learn from your lessons I will shine 
my own way back home, my own way back home to me 
Life has pulled back and forth into doing what I thought I should 
But thanks to you I’m living the life I never thought I could 
You shined my way, you helped me grow 
But sometimes when it’s dark & cold 
I feel lost, without you here I feel 
Chorus: 
I’ll rise from your ashes I will thrive 
I will learn all your lessons I will shine 
My own way back home, my own way back home to me
