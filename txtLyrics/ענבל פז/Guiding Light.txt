I woke up this morning at seven AM 
Took a look in the mirror 
Found I’m still dreamin 
When I opened my eyes 
It was half passes ten 
I poured a cup of coffee 
And read my mail 
But everyday it seems like the day before 
Except that you’re not here anymore 
So I turned on the T.V to clear my head 
I switched through the channels 
And stopped at Dr. Phil 
He was passing put advice 
That seemed to make sense 
He said “you must make a plan 
And seize the day” 
But everyday it seems like the day before 
Except that you’re not here anymore 
And every night I feel your hand touch my mine 
And wake to find my dreams and fly
