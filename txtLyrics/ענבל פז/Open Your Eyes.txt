My eyes are closed 
I feel so cold 
I hear your voice 
I have no choice 
I reach my hands 
Up into the sky 
Trying to grasp it 
Trying to fly 
But you're not there _ 
Youâ€™ve gone away 
And it's just me standing 
With my hands up in the air 
Chorus: 
Open your eyes 
And see whats inside 
Open your eyes 
When your laughter dies 
Open your eyes show what you hide 
Open your eyes when your laughter dies 
My eyes closed 
But I can feel your warmth 
Is it easier now?
