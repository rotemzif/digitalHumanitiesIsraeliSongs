There was a call 
I remember it well and when 
The memory of your laughter 
Like an echo on the other end 
I thought I heard your voice sing 
But I know that it can’t be real 
Even though you’re not here 
Somehow you’re always 
Close to me 
I still see you 
Here in this room 
And all the things we talked about 
I say them all again and try 
To make sense of hope and love 
When I am whispering you name 
I close my eyes I see you again 
I wish that I could tell you 
The love that I hold on to 
Is my strength through my sorrow 
That leads me tomorrow
