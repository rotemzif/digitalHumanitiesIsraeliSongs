It's been three years 
Since I’ve been home 
I looked at my ticket 
Flight number 3-2-1 GO! 
The airport smelled like coffee and crousons. 
I haven’t stopped moving a minute since I’ve been gone 
I’m tired of opinions tired of advice and tired of being criticized. 
I’m Walking the road untaken, moving towards the unknown 
I don’t want to fall asleep and wake up faded 
I can live with mistakes I’m makin, cause I’ll make them on my own 
I don’t want to fall asleep and wake up faded 
At 30,000 feet the plane was like a time machine 
Taking me back to who I used to be 
There’s a million miles and twister in between 
Now I don’t have to hide from the memories or the real me 
Too Long Too misunderstood 
I’m Walking the road untaken, moving towards the unknown 
I don’t want to fall asleep and wake up faded 
I can live with mistakes I’m makin, cause I’ll make them on my own 
I don’t want to fall asleep and wake up faded
