Where did you go? 
when I've searched for answers in your eyes?
Didn’t even look at me
Where did you go? 
Wasn’t I worth just another try 
Baby don’t do this to me
All that I was (baby don’t disappear) 
Just being yours…
And if you'll 
Tell me where to go to find you 
Promise I'll do the biggest crimes 
Tell the biggest lies just to have you
Obsessed and I'll do the time for your love 
And if you'll tell me where to go to find you 
Promise I'll do the biggest crimes 
Tell the biggest lies just to have you
That’s how much I love you 
That I can't belong… to no one but you
What did I lose? 
when I couldn’t see myself at all?
Only what you’ve left of me 
How could I choose? 
Self destruction is much too obvious
Loving you meant hating me, oh
All that she was (whispering in my ear)
"don’t kill yourself, don’t disappear" 
Baby   
Tell me where to go to find you 
Promise I'll do the biggest crimes 
Tell the biggest lies just to have you
Obsessed and I'll do the time for your love 
And if you'll tell me where to go to find you 
Promise I'll do the biggest crimes 
Tell the biggest lies just to have you
That’s how much I love you 
That I can't belong… 
And if you'll tell me where to go to find you 
Promise I'll do…
Tell the biggest lies just to have you
That’s how much I love you 
That I can't belong… to no one but you
When I've searched for answers in your eyes…
