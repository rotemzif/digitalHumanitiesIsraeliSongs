Verse#1
Twenty-five years I'm alive in this world
Searching for a special meaning, 
I've never known someone like you before
In my unending road
I realized in a peculiar way that you're all I need
Yeah, otherwise this whole damn world can fall apart 
I can't deny it, I feel it inside 
I can't explain it, its burnin' inside
So tell me are you gonna break my heart
This whole damn world can fall apart 
Verse#2
No, I'm not afraid to live my life the way I see it
For me you're the only thing, my only remedy
So promise me that you'll treat me right, 
That you'll take care
Cause recently this whole damn world is fallin' apart
So tell me are you gonna break my heart
This whole damn world can fall apart
