DON’T COME TO CONCLUSION 
SPEAKING IN THE NAME OF LOVE
DON’T FORGET THE REASON
SPEAKING IN THE NAME OF LIFE
DON’T FORGET THE CHILDREN 
FEARS AND TEARS IS WHAT THEY HAVE
HIDING IN THE BACK YARD
GROW UP WITH PAIN OF DEATH
ON AND ON
ON AND ON
WAITING FOR SOLUTION
WAITING FOR PEACE TO SHOW
YEARS AND YEARS OFF FIGHTING
YEARS AND YEARS AND MORE TO GO
STANDING BY THE WINDOW
WAITING TIL MORNING COMES
WAN'T TO SEE THE SUNRISE
SHINES THROUGH THE CHILDREN'S EYES
ON AND ON...
CHILDREN HAVE THE RIGHT TO BELIEVE IN 
CHILDREN HAVE THE RIGHT TO BELIEVE IN LIFE >> LIVE AND LOVE
DON’T FORGET THE SECRET
DON’T FORGET THE KEY OF LIFE
PAIN IS NOT THE ANSWER
LOVE AND LOVE AND HOPE WILL BE LOVE
ON AND ON...
CHILDREN HAVE THE RIGHT TO BELIEVE IN 
CHILDREN HAVE THE RIGHT TO BELIEVE IN LIFE >> LIVE AND LOVE
DON’T COME TO CONCLUSION 
SPEAKING IN THE NAME OF LOVE
DON’T FORGET THE CHILDREN 
FEARS AND TEARS IS WHAT THEY HAVE
WAN'T TO SEE THE SUNRISE 
SHINES THROUGH THE CHILDREND'S EYE
ON AND ON...
