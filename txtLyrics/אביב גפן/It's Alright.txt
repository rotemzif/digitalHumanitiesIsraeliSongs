Don't be afraid , it's gonna be a beautiful day 
Try to dance to the rhythm of the dreams in your head 
She may show up later on today, 
Someone's watching you and hears you pray 
It's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright 
Keep on your way, you're gonna make it through today 
A ray of light reflected from your long black hair 
And you can tell the difference from yesterday 
Don't be surprised, it's gonna be a beautiful day 
It's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright 
ooohh.. It's gonna be alright 
It's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright 
It's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright 
Don't be afraid , it's gonna be a beautiful day 
Try to dance, to the rhythm of the dreams in your head 
She may show up later on today, 
Someone's watching you and hears you pray
It's gonna be alright
