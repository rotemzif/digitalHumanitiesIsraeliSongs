There are spaces in between
Neither here, neither there,
They could be anywhere,
This is where I like to live,
close to freedom,
I create my own kingdom.
They say that home is where the heart is
But I'm all alone
Without a home
I've got a homeless heart, or a heartless home,
And that's just the way I want it.
I have loved many people,
Both from east, and from west,
It's hard to choose what I like best.
I'm a citizen of the world,
Working hard, loving harder,
I'm a knight in shining armor.
They say that home is where the heart is
But I'm all alone
Without a home
I've got a homeless heart, or a heartless home
And that's just the way I want it.
Sometimes I get lost
And it's hard to find
The earth
The ground
The roots of my tree
And I'm just floating in the wind
Waiting to see where it takes me
Perhaps one day I'll find a home,
Settle down, once and for all,
But I doubt it, afterallâ€¦.
