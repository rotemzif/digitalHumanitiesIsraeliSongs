I tell the dj play my favorite song
Because tonight we're gonna get it on
Make my way to the dance floor
Everyone is waiting for me to do my thing
Just move on the floor
I wanna see you dance give me some more 
Just just move on the floor 
I wanna see you dance give me some more
So get up jump jump  
I wanna dance like there's no tomorrow
So get up jump jump
I wanna dance the night away
Can't be wasting time at the bar 
Because I gotta be a superstar
Sipping on my jump Ice tea
Everyone is waiting for me to do my thing
Just move on the floor
I wanna see you dance give me some more
Just just move on the floor 
I wanna see you face give me some more
