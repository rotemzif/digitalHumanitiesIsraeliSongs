I look in your eyes
I can see all the signs
Touch me so softly 
Sending shivers down my spine
Let's seize this moment
And lose track of all time
By the end of the night
You'll be mine!
You're mine, you're mine
You and me for all time,
Don't you be worried cuz I'll be 
Right by your side
And we'll be together
And no one can sever
If we could forbid the hands of time
And have eternity for just one night
Cuz I can't let go 
Of what's inside
Ana Bahebak baby
It means I love you baby (tonight) 
Let's start a new life
Let's abandon this night
It doesn't really matter if it's wrong or it's right
It's me and you
Let's not play by the rules
There's nobody in sight
It's just you and I
You're mine, you're mine
You and me for all time,
Don't you be worried cuz I'll be 
Right by your side
And we'll be together
And no one can sever
Hook:
If we could forbid the hands of time
And have eternity for just one night
Cuz I can't let go 
Of what's inside
Ana Bahebak baby
It means I love you baby (tonight)
