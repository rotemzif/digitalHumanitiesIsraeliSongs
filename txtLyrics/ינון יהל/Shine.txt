Watching everything turn around me 
While I'm standing in the place I've always been 
Seems like all these streets run behind me 
And I'm trying to find a way to get back in 
Follow you... 
Slow... 
As these days go by I'll be waiting 
While you find your way through places you don't know 
I'll be standing here never changing 
Only trying to be the place that you call home 
(Call home...) 
I would follow you anywhere you go 
I would run with you however fast or slow 
I would make my way through this dark design 
I would run with you and everything (shine) 
And everything...
