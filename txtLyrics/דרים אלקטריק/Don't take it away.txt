Close the door, don't look around 
I'll be watching…. Waiting… 
Dream of where I can be found 
I will be there again 
Walking down the road so far 
To the morning, the light 
Breaking off that spell away 
That you put on me last night 
Don't take it away from me 
Don't walk away 
Put on your spell on me 
Please stay 
So many days, so lonely nights 
I was watching… waiting… 
For you to come and hold me tight 
I wanna feel it tonight 
I closed my eyes, I ran away 
I was sleeping 'till dawn 
I walked and found myself alone 
'Couse you walked away… you're gone
