Would you stay? when I walk out the door 
Would you say “stay for a moment once more”? 
Would you be, the one that I looked for so long? 
Would you cry “walk out! Stay out!” 
Where are you? The one that I loved every day 
Where’s that day? We met and you answered my prays 
Who’s to say? Our love’s gonna burn like a flame 
Did you feel the Fire? Liar! 
Could it be? Lies that I’ve heard every day 
Could they be? Songs that you wrote when you stayed 
Could they say? Promise of lovin’ each day 
When you said? Lover! Liar! 
I would like to show you the way that I found. 
I’ll break out the spell and the magic around 
I would like to show you the tears that I cried 
As you walked, and sentenced our love to die. 
Liar! No one to blame, nothing to say ( I wanna see you in…) 
Fire! Burning in flames, saying your prayers (Just like you told me..)
