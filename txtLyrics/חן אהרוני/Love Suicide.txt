Walking barefoot down 
The broken stairs
I love you step by step
Playing with your mind 
Is truth or dare
Like Russian roulette 
I can read you like an open book
and it's hard for me to understand
All of this years how long it took
I'm starting all over again
When tomorrow kills yesterday
And we have nothing left to say
Call on the sunrise
Let it burn the pain
Let it burn Before our Love Suicide
Walking barefoot right 
On broken hearts  
I hate you step by step
I'm shattered to Pieces but 
I know you're there
I'm learning to accept
I can read you like an open book
and it's hard for me to understand
All of this years how long it took
I'm starting all over again
When tomorrow kills yesterday
And we have nothing left to say
Call on the sunrise
Let it burn the pain
Let it burn Before our Love Suicide
