Hey, What you looking for?
Hey, we’ve been down this road.
You took my heart and played with it till it broke
you said you’re mine and then you lost control.
And if you think I’m a fool…
I’m sending you my hate 
cause you don’t deserve my love, no
I’m leaving you behind 
I don’t need you anymore, yeah
Cause these are crazy times
and you’re my crazy crime
I’m sending you my hate 
cause you don’t deserve my love
Don’t try to stop me now
Don’t try to win this fight.
You stole my nights, the best years of my life
You kissed another man but said you’re mine.
And if you think I’m a fool…
I’m sending you my hate 
cause you don’t deserve my love, no
I’m leaving you behind 
I don’t need you anymore. yeah
Cause these are crazy times
and you’re my crazy crime
I’m sending you my hate 
cause you don’t deserve my love
And if you think I’m a fool…
Cause these are crazy times
and you’re my crazy crime
and you are crazy...
I’m sending you my hate 
cause you don’t deserve my love.
