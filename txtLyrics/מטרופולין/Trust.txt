I trust you like I trust the chains 
 Or anyone I can 
 Can you remember the way 
 When every lane 
 You burning in flames 
 Trust in you like playing with fire in flames 
 Can you escape from hell? 
 Can you imagine what caused the pain? 
 I really wanna take you away 
 Hiding place where no one can contain 
 The shit I'm writing today 
 You trusted me in vain 
 Whatever happens you'll be safe in those hands 
 Safe without no man 
 I trusted you in vain
