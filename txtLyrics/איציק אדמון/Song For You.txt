All day long 
I think about a song 
That would be 
A song for every one 
All day long 
I think of what went wrong 
As I sing A song for you 
I don't know Where I am going 
And I don't know who we are 
I don't know what I believe in 
Well, I don't want to think so far 
Silent dreams and silent kisses 
And a silent memory 
Like a child that comes back home 
He doesn't come back home 
Come back home to me 
Every night 
I think about your love 
And tonight I wrote a song for you 
Every night 
I think about your smile 
As I sing, A song for you 
Every word has got a meaning 
But every word we say is free 
And you can take it as you want it 
It doesn't matter much to me 
Every dream has got a meaning 
But every dream we have is free 
And you can dream it as you want it 
It doesn't matte much to me 
Every time has got a meaning 
But we are living here and now 
And you can live it as you want it 
It really doesn't 
It doesn't matter how
