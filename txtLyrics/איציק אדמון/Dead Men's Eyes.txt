There is someone else inside of me 
Never let me hope or let me be 
There is no reason left to change the wide world 
Changing a life who sees a life made of gold 
There is someone walking in my sleep 
Doesn't have a love or soul to keep 
There is no reason left to live and be raged 
Changing a life which isn't meant to be changed 
We're fighting the waves fighting the trees 
There is no power left in me 
Fighting the days fighting the hours 
There is no reason to send flowers 
And now you are wise 
You're looking through a dead man eyes 
There is someone playing in our dreams 
We have got to pay the price it seems 
Fading along with love that we're not to glance 
There are no dreams or hope no love only plans 
We're fighting the waves fighting the trees...
