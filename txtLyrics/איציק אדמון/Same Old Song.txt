Taking what you're taking from me 
I hope I can keep my love alive 
Looking back on when I was free 
And how I have loved your tear stained eyes 
Now I'm standing right by the door 
I really don't know, what I'm looking for 
You know I think I'm really not sure 
If I want to let go 
And I am waiting 
I am waiting 
I've been waiting far to long 
And I am waiting 
I am waiting 
While I sing the same old song 
Now that you are back in my life 
The tears are not gone, they only hide 
And in the end, those feelings was right 
And into my world they now collide 
You know I never said I was strong 
And I know I was wrong, I know I was wrong 
And now I'm with my back to the wall 
When you're coming home 
And I am waiting...
