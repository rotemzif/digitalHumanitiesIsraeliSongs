you will see my own way
not to lose my song again
now i think i found myself living
living.
you won’t disappoint me
just believe in your way
now I think i found myself
here I feel.
build everything about my love again
build another place in me
build everything about my love again
build another place in me
you wil see that you know
if you let yourself go
swim with thoughts of sweet dreams
sweet dreams
lied to myself a hundred times
i’ll open up my life, my life
lied to myself a hundred times
i’ll open up my life, my life
you will see my own way
not to lose my song again
now i think i found myself living
living
