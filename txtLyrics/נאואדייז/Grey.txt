Don't you know the sun isn't round 
all the waterfalls and seashells you find 
Stays the same as I've been an envy of all 
you had your hand on 
Once you've gone I'm all alone 
I'm running around 
fading to the crowd 
a call in your name 
wears out fades into the grey 
Don't you know the walls never end here 
if only god keep them aside 
all in all 
you'll never be left on your own 
never be left out 
Once you've gone I'm all alone... 
I could have been your way out 
But once you've gone I'm all alone 
I'm running around 
fading to the crowd 
a call in your name 
wears out fades into the grey 
waiting for you to return home
