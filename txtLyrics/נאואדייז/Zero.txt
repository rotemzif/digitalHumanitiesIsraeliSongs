You once said that all in all its lost 
But now you're treating me and her 
Is it worth the try? 
You would tell no difference there by you eyes 
And I won't be one worthy laying on the grass 
You just won't believe it 
We will fly 
But now again my sense keep telling 
Is it worth the try? 
You would tell no difference there by you eyes 
And I won't be one worthy laying on the grass 
My melody sings 
My heart beats 
My head spins around 
Around Ah
