I'm on the edge I think I'm insane 
all I want is for this thing to end 
the pain grow stronger 
co's no one understands 
I'm on the edge 
I know I won't be coming back 
from this hole 
to my world 
I'm scared there is no end 
I'm scared there is no end 
I don't know why I'm scared 
I'm scared there is no end 
I'm scared there is no answer 
I don't know why I'm scared 
I'm scared there is no end 
I'm scared there is no answer 
I don't know why I'm scared
