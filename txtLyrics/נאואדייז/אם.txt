A cold disease in nowhere 
life ain't gonna fear it or allow 
in anyway it 
could to cut you off 
leave you off the way 
read in my own hands the truth 
will I ever be myself 
when I know you've always knew 
What is love for other one's 
What is right and what is wrong 
What is god in all he owns 
and what is the truth, what is the truth 
Coming round, through the rain 
the coldness of the ground 
could you tell me where's the sun 
I'm back 
in rage and I'm over the edge 
and I want you to be what I want you to be for me 
off the sand, into the sea 
But what if love is other one's 
What if right becoming wrong 
What if god has cut me off 
what if it's true, what if it's true 
What if love is other one's 
What if right becoming wrong 
What if god has cut me off, off
