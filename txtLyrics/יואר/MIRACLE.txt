when all the tears that I've cried are gone
i keep dreaming on living on flying on
when all that used to take me down is gone
i keep dreaming on living on flying on
i believe in miracles and here's one
all the blues and sorrows passed away
i believe in magic of touch and sound
of the moon, the sun, night and day
REF
and i thought
i could drink your love
to the very last drop
when all your words that you've said are true
you behold the happiness of being you
when all my tunes that i've sang come live
you are dancing all through the life
dancing every moment sharp as a blade
one after another to the drums and pipes
the invisible gold of which your soul is made
gently rings the tunes of happy days
REF
and i thought
i could drink your love
to the very last drop
