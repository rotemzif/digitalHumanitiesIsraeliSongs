Ja cansei de estar sozinha 
Sei que um dia eu vou ter 
Teu carinho 
When the moon lights 
Im outta my mind 
and your kisses 
are sweeter then wine 
When the skyline 
Stretches till dawn 
I can hold you
Endless in time, in time 
Get away
In the middle of nowhere
I just need for you to be there 
Million people and I don’t care 
Cause all of the light I share 
It is just for you 
of nowhere in the middle
I just need for you 
to be there 
Million people and I don’t care
Million stars just for you
