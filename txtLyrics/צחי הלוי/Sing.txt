the beginning of a trip for a beat boy hip 
with a name of a giving kind 
natural it seems what oceans to us bring 
tranquillity love of live 
confusion all around every second every tick 
but time never stops to click 
what's the way out from it all 
i mean it when i ask now can we find a way 
sing the song of sunshine 
sing the song of sun 
sing the song of sea shores 
where ever you may be 
sing the song of sunshine 
sing the song of sun 
sing the song along with us 
where ever you may be 
sometimes it seems so clear 
talks are all the same 
sometimes it seems so clear to me 
no matter what your name 
like when drops of water form the seas 
and bring us their vitality 
a light shines in us all 
united in humanity 
sing the song of sunshine...
