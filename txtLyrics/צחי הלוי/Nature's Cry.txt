beauty arises from the bottom of me 
your smile and your loving brings a better view 
skies painted in blue 
sun embracing you 
a child with a lifetime experience says hello 
as oranges shine at you when you pass by 
a child running through the field of flowers 
gives me pride 
an old shattered house makes you wonder how 
all is in place so radiant with grace 
stop being blindfolded it's about time 
start to appreciate the simplicity of me 
stop ruining everything with hypocrisy and lies 
understand me 
created i was to nourish you 
cherishing the moments i see you grow 
arousing your heart soul searching is hard 
enlighten your mind find in 
me what you need to survive 
stop being blindfolded it's about time... 
harming my stability brings you 
closer to the end 
for as beauty arises so does disaster and pain 
in peace i come let's be as one 
i'm a mother my patience won't die 
but me my mind 
goes out to those who are still to come
