feelin' dire over looking time passing you 
darkness falls upon you let the 
sadness pass you by oh bye-bye 
your looks the matter of the day 
so effected by what the people say 
some have wrinkles hair turning white 
you might be loosing yours tonight 
hey yo hey yo hey yo 
good times here we go 
hey yo hey yo hey yo 
feel the good times 
so concentrated in trying to make it 
study late at night do the best you can 
striving hard untill i make it 'till the end 
to find a letter saying "i'm gone.." 
to booze you say "hey hey" 
not only that but you hear a buzz 
she's warming up her body 
with your best pal's lip 
deep low man frustration overblows your mind 
submitted to the sorrows of your life 
hey yo hey yo hey yo... 
media is a drag 
facts and lies 
people loosing morals ego driven 
tainted hearts and blasted views 
so what more can we do? 
hey yo hey yo hey yo...
