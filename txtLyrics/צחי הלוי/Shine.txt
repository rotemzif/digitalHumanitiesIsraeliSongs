let it shine 
shine on me shine on you 
shine on us shine on 
once again 
thinking 'bout a change 
once again 
having to rearrange 
keep the faith you say to me 
harmony and ryhme will be 
if you just keep on trying 
happiness you'll know 
time to feed your soul 
let it shine... 
it all may seem so weird 
talking 'bout things not so clear 
so let me put things straight 
open up your mind dig this 
humanity equality serenity 
the power of the mind 
mercy mercy mercy me 
may all these keep on shining 
mercy mercy mercy me 
on the ignorance and pride 
mercy mercy mercy me 
let me live this fantasy 
let it shine...
