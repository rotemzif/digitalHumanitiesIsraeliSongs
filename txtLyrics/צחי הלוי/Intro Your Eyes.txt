remember we have all been here before 
this time you rock 
the next you roll 
can we afford this misery 
seems clear to me 
some are in pain never knowing love 
living heartache and shame 
those of us who do can try to make it through 
'cause we know love 
you should know right know 
before i fall i'll always gaze 
into your eyes 
right here right now 
i promise you love 
into your eyes i'll gaze 
so they say the end is near 
you're on your own you live in fear 
there's nothing you can change 
with reality so far beyond 
understanding right from wrong 
what is evil? what is good? 
good is every baby 
a solemn promise must be made 
to spread out love amidst the hate 
you should know right know... 
right before i break 
you know i swear 
i'll take another look your way
