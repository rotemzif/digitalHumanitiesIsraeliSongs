i've been alone 
i've been alone for so long 
and i have seen the madness 
of the living ghosts 
i've been crying out 
i've been screaming shouting out 
loud never ever feeling a change at all 
oh no 
i am a man 
ain't got no feelings 
never ever showing my pain 
i know you want 
i know you want me yes you do 
i feel your pumping heart and the heat below 
but what you think to be 
pure strong love 
is nothing but a game for me 
you wanna see me crawling up to you 
just like a dog but just remember 
i am a man... 
i see you learned 
you got the message 
we can start now 
releasin' all the pressure 
or we can play on forever 
acting so happy 
i am a man...
