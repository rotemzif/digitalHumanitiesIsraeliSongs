think it's time for me to go 
to plant a seed 
to help it grow 
my woman and me 
we're together now 
me and she 
you enlighten my soul 
and i'm bound to grow 
just like all around 
well you can be broke 
have no money 
what if money is a state of mind 
sometimes you do 
sometimes you don't 
you enlighten my soul... 
it has all been said before 
we are bulls on fire
