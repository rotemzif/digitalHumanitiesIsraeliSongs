taking many things in life for granted 
is the way you play 
cards that you were given 
lucky your were to be born this way 
putting on sun glasses no you cannot hide racist 
must find another scapegoat 
frustration inner conflicts 
try to understand 
this ain't about you nor 'bout me 
you can break my arms 
in my mind i am free 
don't mess around with money mess around with your brains 
where did you go wrong? i'm not your doll to blame 
be what you wanna be for me to see what you wanna see in me 
be what you wanna be for me to see what you really see in me 
so the streets are mighty jungles many monkeys roam with fear 
on the way to make a fortune on the way to beg for pay 
once you were a king all mighty your reality domain 
non existent slavery-T.V you i praise 
try to understand T.V screens to blow your mind 
playing the game take a side being blind 
you don't have to love me you don't have to pay my rent 
i'm just a monkey i'm your neighbor i'm your friend 
be what you wanna be for me to see... 
you're so false i see right through you i can bear no more 
you don't like me that's o.k 'cause frankly i won't play your game 
be what you wanna be for me to see...
