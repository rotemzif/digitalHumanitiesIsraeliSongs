Today I picked up on this life again,
and caught a chance they were giving me,
in my head - lies, something weird to say,
 I can feel the road ahead of me.
On my way, blinded by the sunlight,
when I drive the 405.
Those blank stares of people - passing me by,
getting close to where they need to be…
maybe it’s a good place to start,
start from scratch, see how lucky you are being here. 
and I wanna work hard, every day,
until the sweet weekend lay my head to sleep.
Today, thoughts of you are here to stay,
I only need you when you’re gone,
you said belief is in this heart again,
but you’re too far away to know and
you’re making it right when you say my name,
eventually this road will lead me to be.... 
yeah
