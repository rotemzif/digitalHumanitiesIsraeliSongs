MONEY LEADS TO MORE MONEY
POWER TO MORE POWER
MONEY LEADS TO MORE MONEY
TOP FLOOR IN THE HIGHEST TOWER
HE'S THE MONEY MAN OF THE HOUR
TOP FLOOR IN THE HIGHEST TOWER
GOT DEALS THEY SPREAD LIKE FIRE
WILL PUSH IT AND GET IT HIGHER
HIS MONEY MAKING LIKE MEDITATION
HE CANNOT RESIST THE TEMPTATION
MONEY MONEY MONEY GIVE HIM VIBRATION
MONEY MONEY MONEY AS DESTINATION
HE PAYS IN CASH AND BUYS WHATEVER HE CAN HOLD
HE TAKES THE TRASH AND TURNS IT INTO GOLD
MONEY LEADS TO MORE MONEY
POWER TO MORE POWER
MONEY LEADS TO MORE MONEY
TOP FLOOR IN THE HIGHEST TOWER
MONEY LEADS TO MORE MONEY
FEAR LEADS TO PARANOIA
MONEY LEADS TO MORE MONEY
WAS VERY NICE TO KNOW YA
HE PAYS IN CASH AND BUYS WHATEVER HE CAN HOLD
HE TAKES THE TRASH AND TURNS IT INTO GOLD
