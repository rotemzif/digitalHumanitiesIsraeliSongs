Pekeyake na kusikia kwa mwezi/ Yatima alilia ndani kivuli/ 
Pekeyake na kusikia kwa mwezi/ Maisha anasali kuopolewa/ 
Amezungukazunguka mbali sana/ Sasa hajui barabara ya kwake/ 
Dunia inajua hadithi yake/ Lakini nani ajua jina lake? 
Mwezi, ukipo/ Urudi ili atafarijiwa/ Mwezi, ukipo/ 
Urudi ili aweza kulala/ Mwezi, ukipo/ Urudi ili atafarijiwa/ 
Mwezi, ukipo/ Naomba kwa maisha/ Urudi kwa maisha 
Alone and listening to the light of the moon 
An orphaned child cried to the shadows 
Alone and listening to the light of the moon 
Maisha prayed for someone to save her 
Sheâ€™d wandered for so very far 
That she no longer knew her way home 
The whole world knows her story 
But no one knows her name 
Moon, if you are there 
Return so that she might be comforted 
Moon, if you are there 
Return so that she can sleep 
Moon, if you are there 
Return so that she might be comforted 
Moon, if you are there 
I am begging for Maisha 
Return for Maisha
