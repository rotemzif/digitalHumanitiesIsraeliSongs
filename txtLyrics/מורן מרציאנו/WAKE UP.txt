LIVE YOUR LIFE THROUGH A GLASS
YOU LOVE THAT MOMENT THAT JUST PASSED
PRETENDING THAT IT'S ALL REAL
EVERY DAY NINE TO FIVE
KEEP ON SMILING THEN YOU DIVE
DOWN BELOW IT
TIME TO WAKE UP
ALL THAT INFO THAT YOU GET
KILLS AMBITION TO CREATE
YOU ARE NUMB AND PARALYZED
DREAMS AND NIGHTMARES NO DIFFERENCE THERE
YOU DON'T REMEMBER YOU ONCE CARED
OF WHAT THERE IS AROUND
TIME TO WAKE UP
TIME YOU WILL WAKE UP
NO ISSUES TO DISCUSS
NO HUMAN BEINGS THAT YOU TRUST
FAITH IS A LIE
FAITH IS ALIVE
TIME TO WAKE UP
TIME YOU WILL WAKE UP
TIME TO SCREAM OUT
TIME TO SCREAM OUT LOUD
SCREAM OUT
YOU BETTER SCREAM OUT
