my mama told me son since you were born 
I'm happy every day 
but now she says my son you're sometimes wrong 
you need to find your way 
mama told me once a story of a guy who never failed 
but for me It never happened they just put me back in jail 
mama don't know what I'm doing here 
all those nights have been so long 
and I've been so far away I'm coming home 
my mama told me son with all those girls 
you need to be o.k 
but now she says my son you need to know 
that sometimes girls don't stay 
and I've met a girl so pretty she was tall with long blond hair 
she knew places in the city and we made love everywhere 
mama she told me that she loves me 
when my money ran she's gone 
and I've been so far away I'm coming home 
It's now 4 o'clock this morning starts with clouds and heavy rain 
on the platform were I'm standing waiting up for western trains 
mama sold my songs for nothing on the streets I'm all alone 
and I've been so far away I'm coming home
