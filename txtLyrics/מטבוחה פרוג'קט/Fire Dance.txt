Show me the spark of creation
Rejoice in a big celebration
Give honor for  all of the nation
Unity and love from Jah Jah creation
So welcome tonight is the night
Everybody come and dance and feel all right
Spread Jah love instead of fight
Together we shall bring Jah light
So everybody move your body to the local motion
Madboojah sound they are cooking a wicked session
Mc Daboor upon the microphone in a style Jamaican
Trance galactic trance bombastic a journey trance creation
now Listen for a while maawall is the style
Coming to the nation to free you from exile
Babylon is a robot that is made of metal
Love your neighbor as yourself this is fundamental
So welcome tonight is the night
Everybody come and dance and feel all right
Spread Jah love instead of fight
Together we shall bring Jah light
So run it to bring a new sensation
Madbojah sound in a boom celebration
Run away but not without intension
Freedom and love is the healing of the nation
