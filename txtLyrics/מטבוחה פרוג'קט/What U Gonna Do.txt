What You Gonna Do 
Time to be attentive
Social and connective
What You Gonna Do
Someone across the ocean
Wanna share emotion
Loving and devotion
What You Gonna Do
Can’t be no confusion
This is no illusion
It’s a new age fusion
What You Gonna Do
Change your life and make it
Keep it real don’t fake it
Just reach out and take it
What You Gonna Do
You’ve seen what I’ve seen
You’ve been where I’ve been
You’ve felt what I feel
With a touch of the wind
