After I started realizing, I didn't want to miss any moment 
After I left my life, I couldn't want to waste single moment 
Can't close my eyes anymore 
Can't stop believing 
After all I'm just a man with ambition 
I'm on mission 
I'm staring at the mirror 
And I can't see my face 
After I chucked away the shit 
My goal became important again 
After a year in the darkness, the sun is rising again 
Can't shut my mouth anymore 
It depends on god willing 
After all I'm just a man with ambition 
I'm on mission 
I'm staring at the mirror 
And I can't see my face 
The mission started back in Israel 
The mission continues in the u.s.a 
Europe I'm on my way 
Passing over is not an option 
After all I'm just a manâ€¦
