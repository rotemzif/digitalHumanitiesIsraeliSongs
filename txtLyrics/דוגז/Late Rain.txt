Late rain 
Has stirred the staging 
Once and twice 
And I hope it will again 
young man 
Prepared for landing 
Hold the railing 
I will turn up the gain 
Mellow melody 
Airplanes in the sky 
Yesterday belongs to yesterday 
Paused game 
Cannot stand the waiting 
Bare the tailing 
Lift the cases up and down 
Travel north and south 
30 calls â€“ they never come 
one dreamer with instruments 
and potential off course
