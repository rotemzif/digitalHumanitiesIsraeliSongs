How was i to know
You sold out your feelings before you could go
I'm taking it slow
Before it's too late
I will see the rainbow
And i know I'm scared
Facing the demons that you never shared
Your feelings are spared
But I'll say your name every night in my prayers
Over and over again
I didn't know how lost i was when i met you
Over and over again
I didn't know how lost i was without you
Over and over again
I didn't know how lost i was when i met you
Over and over again
I didn't know how lost i was without you
How was i to know
You sold out your feelings before you could go
I'm taking it slow
Before it's too late
I will see the rainbow
And i know I'm scared
Finding the demons that you never dammed
Your feelings are dead
But I'll say your name every night in my prayers
Over and over again
I didn't know how lost i was when i met you
Over and over again
I didn't know how lost i was without you
Over and over again
I didn't know how lost i was when i met you
Over and over again
I didn't know how lost i was without you
Over and over again
Over and over again
