I can’t recall
I can’t recall my youth
Was it wasn't it
I can’t realize
This life is passing by
In the pale morning light
I can hardly breathe
I’m giving up the fight
Release
Me
My soul is crying for love
Demolished thoughts are fading away
A king with a paper crown
A clown, who never learned to pray
My heart can’t heal the wounds
Struggling for each breath every day
A Catherine’s wheel of life
Crushes down on me again
I can’t forget
Those shadey corridors
Was it Wasn’t it
I can’t recognize
Who’s staring at me
From a mirror
In the pale morning light
I can hardly breathe
I’m giving up the fight
Release
Me
My soul is crying for love
Demolished thoughts are fading away
A king with a paper crown
A clown, who never learned to pray
My heart can’t heal the wounds
struggling for every breath each day
A Catherine’s wheel of life
Crushes down on me again
Tired of lying
I feel like im dying
My soul is crying for love
Demolished thoughts are fading away
A king with a paper crown
A clown, who never learned to pray
My heart can’t heal the wounds
struggling for every breath each day
A Catherine’s wheel of life
Crushes down on me again
Crushes down on me again
