Deep deep in the mines
I’m digging dirt
Someone is shouting
But there is so much noise
Forgot that there is another way, my cough and a repetitive
dismay
The heart of earth is my last resort we breathe together
Seed and fertile spot
She’s pumping all the blood in my veins
Only here I feel
Inside her warm embrace
Bad bad day
It wets my fire
Must be the
prosecutor's day
I can not hide it
Scratching walls of mud
With my thoughts I know I have a jewel but now I’m lost
Deep deep lonely time and time
And soil and having nothing at all
Dark shades and respiration shakes
Move up motion low
Two floors more
Gain game gain gain game
