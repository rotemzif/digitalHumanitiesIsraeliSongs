rhythm is no secret to me 
i am  keeping my time for you, see
all i was and what should ever be
i am trying to base it on it
i assume the sympathy
doesn't come easy for you dear 
i'll try not to take it personally 
but i warn you, i don't think its funny.
I am trying to base it on it..
Put some pepper in your step
hold your horses before cashing your chips
on the bright side any time day or night
over stretch our generosity
dial it back, your pushing me
don't block my view i would like to see
Since i'm not anyone else to keep
i am choosing to dance with you dear
i am trying to base it on it..
Rise into a place you are
and no matter how far you think the stars are
Thrive to reach the stars above
and no matter how far you think they are 
I am trying to base it on it 
(Everybody telling me it's gonna be all right
I don't even know if I am wrong or I am right
if we wanna get somewhere we better let it be 
not to choke each others dreams by digging in our heels)
