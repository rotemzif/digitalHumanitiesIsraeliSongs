The sun's not ready to set yet 
Still hanging in your eyes 
I'm waiting for the night to come now 
Because I've never kissed the sun 
Now, I can watch children coming back home 
And I can hear your voice when your mommy calls 
And I can see things that aren't real at all 
When we are sitting 
Eating time 
And you can see no sorrow in my eyes 
While the shadows are getting longer 
And I can feel my day turning into a song 
When we are sitting 
Eating time 
I'm waiting for the night to come now 
Because I've never kissed the sun 
But the sun is not ready to set yet 
Still hanging in your eyes 
In your eyes
