So the question remains, is it all the same
Do you feel like some things will never change again
Cause history can find a way to make it happen, so happens
And if it's all about the search for path in life
In the background of the sound of fear and cry
And no one knows who's right
Outside the circular fight 
But I'm not afraid of you!
Unnecessary tension… 
we're caught in the middle of this fucking war
It's part of our convictions
My only chance for more
And what about all the things that could have mattered instead
What about the dreams that made us fools not sad
Can someone make a difference in this broken place (would you look at my face)
Intoxicated from the views of destruction and all the stories there (and what the truth can bare)
And no one cares who's right
Outside the circular fight 
But I'm not afraid of you!
Unnecessary tension… 
we're caught in the middle of this fucking war
I'm not afraid of this no more
