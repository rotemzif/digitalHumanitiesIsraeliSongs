One day you'll fall asleep and you'll never wake up, just fade out
Donâ€™t throw your dreams away, when shadow surrounds you, step into the light
Sometimes it's hard to face the aching of losing, those you can't replace
Black clouds across the sky, blocking the sun light, you just might fall
I'm falling, can you save me now
I'm falling, you're the only one
Not all is lost my dear
You still can make it, break it
I'll always be right here standing beside you, just take my hand
