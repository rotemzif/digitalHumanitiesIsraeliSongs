I can see your eyes
Cold and resigned
Trying to glimpse inside the secret corners of my mind
I can feel your words 
Judging my silence
And I wonder if you realize just what you're asking.
Would it be the same if I let you get in?
'cause I would let you touch
But not get under my skin
There's more to me than what meets the eye
It's not a lie
It's just my way to get by
You say you want all of me
You want to see all my faces
Think you can handle it?
Think you can handle what I am?
You say you want all of me
You want to see all my faces
Think you can handle it?
Do you think you can handle me?
I'm so tired of this guessing game
You want me to give up my mask
I'm not some pet you're gonna tame
I'm not ready to reveal the parts that are hurting in me
Although it's anyway those parts
That you never seem to see
You say you want all of me
You want to see all my faces
Think you can handle it?
Think you can handle what I am?
You say you want all of me
You want to see all my faces
Think you can handle it?
Do you think you can handle me?
You are right
The doors are closed for a reason
So you better not pry
Out of reach
From this human connection
That is getting harder and harder to satisfy
You say you want all of meâ€¦
