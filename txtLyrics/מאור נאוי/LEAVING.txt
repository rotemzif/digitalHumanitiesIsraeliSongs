So you are leaving
For your different kind of life
And leaving my behind
Will you
Forget all what we had
I see you are packing
For your other kind of life
I’m sitting right behind
You,
Already fading from my face
I feel that I am weaker than yesterday
I feel that I’ll be missing you everyday
'
My empty pages
 Filled with lines without you
My darkest hours
 Filled with lights from 
Someone new  
I feel that I have been saved by myself
When you're walking
In your other kind of life
Will someone else find you?
And steal all your love?
I feel that I am weaker than yesterday
I feel that I’ll be missing you in every day
In the night we used to dance
Like there is no tomorrow
To end our time
When the sun came we
Turned off her lights
So we could have just one more night
I feel that I’ll be missing you
