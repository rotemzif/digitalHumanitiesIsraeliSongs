My whole body aches
I can't feel my fingers
I've got blue marks
On my back and on my soul
My whole body suffers
From your words
I'm physically not strong
And mentally going wrong
How can I keep going
And how long will it take
And if it's hurt more
Then I might break?
My whole body aches
And my soul is black
 I never felt this way
,I never said goodbye all the way
 Anyway
How can I keep going
And how long will it take
And if i'ts hurt more
Then I might break?
La la la la 
My whole body aches
And I can't say
To you how I feel
I need to be strong
I need not to pick up the phone
And tell you
That you were
A really nice
Mistake
My little mistake
My little mistake
My little mistake
My little mistake
And how long will it take
My whole body aches
I have blue marks
On my toes and on my back
And my soul is black
And it's time to let go
But how long will take
Till you'll be a nice memory
From my mistake
