I'm amazed, that i'm still standing here 
I'm amazed,that is still kind of clear 
I'm amazed that you still want me 
In down deep in this endless sea 
Swimming for my life, to here 
I'm amazed, each day i'm awake 
I'm amazed, this time no mistake 
I'm amazed that you still want me 
Despite the promise of eternity 
I survived, I'm alive, you see 
You watched me up you watched me down 
you helped me up when i made no sound 
I survived, you see 
I'm amazed....
