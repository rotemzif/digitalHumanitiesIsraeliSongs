Don't wanna be that man 
don't wanna feel like a stain upon your shame 
don't wanna go when it's turning late 
just wanna be with you 
and drink lemonade 
oh can't you see 
oh can't you see 
Don't wanna be that man 
don't wanna leave when you're hanging with your friends 
don't wanna walk alone in the rain 
just wanna be with you 
and chill in the back 
oh can't you see 
Cause when i'm waching you 
you look a little sad 
Come on baby be with me 
i'm gonna make it o.k 
Gonna make you smile 
Gonna make you feel free 
Give me your heart 
Baby you will see
