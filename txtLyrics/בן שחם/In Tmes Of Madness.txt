In times of madness 
in times of war 
we are sitting so quietly 
and waiting for more 
What have we done to you 
i really don't know 
Pease pass me the bread my friend 
cause the soup is getting cold 
In times of separation 
in times of supremacy 
We are living in silence 
and waiting to be judged 
What have we done to you 
i really don't know 
Please pass me the soap my child 
cause the shower is getting tox 
Megalomanias 
so vicious and mean 
Will they still have their mega power 
without their thing
