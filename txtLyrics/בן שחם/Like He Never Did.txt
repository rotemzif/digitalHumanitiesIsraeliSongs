Blowing hard 
and slowing down 
it's hard to see 
the finish line 
Only you are on his mind 
your lips that melt 
his frozen lies 
and he loves you 
like he never did 
Blowing hard 
and slowing down 
it's hard to see 
the finish line 
Only you only you 
are on his mind 
your eyes that cool 
his burning nights 
and he loves you 
like he never did
