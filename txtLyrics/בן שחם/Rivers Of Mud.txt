streets becoming like rivers of mud 
i'm sitting on the roof of my house 
i'm staring at the distance 
looking at the vistas 
and realize what i've lost 
cars are washing away upside down 
people swimming for a solid ground 
i'm staring at the distance 
looking at the vistas 
and realize what i've lost 
i need to find a shelter 
from the rain 
everybody needs a place 
for a hideaway
