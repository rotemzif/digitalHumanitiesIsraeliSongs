My life are spinning round with my emotions 
will i tell her how i feel? 
Will she reject me or except me 
i don't know but i have to figure out 
My life are passing by with my creation 
i'm picturing her in my mind 
There she's my lover my lust and desire 
see the fire in her eyes 
But hopes they are remaining like a secret 
will she hear them when i'm passing by 
and when can i find courage in my eyes 
Will i ever speak loud
