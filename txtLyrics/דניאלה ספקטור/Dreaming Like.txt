Nothing can harm you 
my baby i'm near you 
all the time 
Stories and poems 
will tell you the world is 
simple and rhymed 
Close your eyes now 
dreaming like 
and watch 
Crossing the distance 
will make all the difference 
of where is your home 
Did you get lost there 
Are you all alone 
Are you happy 
Close your eyes now 
dreaming like 
and watch
