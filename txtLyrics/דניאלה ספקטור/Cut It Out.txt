I love you 
No you don't 
I love you 
No you don't 
I love you 
No you don't 
I love you 
No you don't love me 
all you love is your love 
I need you 
I wish you had 
I need you 
I wish you had 
I need you 
I wish you had 
I need you 
I wish you had, all you need 
is a wall to bounce your ball 
against to 
So cut it out 
I feel you touching me 
I want you get inside my 
heart is made of wood 
and you can burn it out 
and grow it back again 
(grow it back again) 
You know I can't 
read between 
your quiet lines 
your rhythmic words 
your little rhymes 
I wish I could you know 
I wish I could you know 
So cut it out
