Summer picture with the two of us 
Feels like poetry to me 
Letting time to drift away from us 
On a timeless land we're left to be 
With our mindless heart 
and our heartless mind 
We find everyday 
how its hard to find 
a friend 
I remember playing hide and seek 
I called for you all night but you were gone 
and when they found you sleeping in the creek 
you said you wanted little time alone 
With your mindless heart 
and your heartless mind 
though we think the same 
we're two different kinds 
my friend 
Now you play the deaf and I the blind 
holding to each other like a child 
when you call I turn my head aside 
I cry out but you never hear me cry 
With our mindless heart 
and our heartless mind 
we find every day 
how its hard to find 
peaces lost in time 
of yourself and mine 
my friend
