You are my sun 
when you'll go I'll be gone 
out of my mind 
wish i could be more like your kind 
and shine myself on 
You say you're not 
what i see in you but 
I know I know 
you don't really want me to go 
and leave you alone 
Cant you tell 
we are just like 
mother and sun... 
Love has a way 
taking us apart every day a bit 
and a bit till its all gone 
I don't believe in that 
so why do you 
Cant you tell 
we are just like 
mother and sun...
