All the things I’ll be 
hover over me 
waiting patiently 
Dreams are like a flood 
music in my blood 
and I am listening 
When I’ll come around 
I will find you there 
where you were all along 
but I cant reach you 
All the things you said 
are lying in my head 
making it so hard for me to see 
that love, it is a land 
and home is in your hand 
and I am on a life long odyssey 
When I’ll come around... 
When I’ll come around 
hope that you do too 
I am not so sure anymore 
what I was listening to
