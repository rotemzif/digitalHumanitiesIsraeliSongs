I see trees of green red roses too 
I see em bloom  for me and for you 
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
I see skies of blue clouds of white 
Bright blessed daysdark sacred nights 
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
The colors of a rainbow so pretty in the sky 
Are also on the faces of people going by 
I see friends shaking hands sayin how do you do 
They're really sayin i love you
I hear babies cry I watch them grow 
They'll learn much more than I'll never know 
And I think to myself  what a wonderful world 
And I think to myself  what a wonderful world
