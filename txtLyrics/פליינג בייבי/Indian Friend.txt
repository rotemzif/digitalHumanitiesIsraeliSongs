Down near the lake yes
No room for mistakes no
Indian friend
Was shot in the back by his hater
Good to be good yes
Bad to be good no
You better open your eyes
If you go down to the lake 
Ooh, I want to stay with you
I want to stay with you
I want to stay here
Thru thick and thru thin
Keep touching my skin 
My mother said yes
My father said no
My brother said, boy
You better run far away
Down near the lake
Where the reds have been shot
Revenge is calling
Self revolution takes care for everything 
Ooh, I want to stay with you
I want to stay with you
I want to stay here
Thru thick and thru thin
Keep touching my skin 
Although I'm bigger than my physical size
Still, I'm to scared to open my mouth or my heart
Where is my heart?
Where is my mind?
One more time...
