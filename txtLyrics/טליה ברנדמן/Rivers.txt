I thought that I had you
But then it occurred, you said
Please, can you give back my heart
I fell on my knees
And I said to you, please
Can we go back and make a fresh start
Then you said, hey…
All the rivers will break us apart
Hey… but the rivers were there from the start
Hold me, feels like I’m falling
Feels like I’m falling so hard
Remember we stood on the bridge
When the waters
were gushing as thunder and lust
But on the next day you were gone
I could see how
You burned all the bridges to dust
Like you said, hey…
All the rivers will break us apart
Hey… don’t you see, they were there from start
Hold me, feels like I’m falling
Feels like I’m falling so hard
