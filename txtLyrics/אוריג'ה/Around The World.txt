Wife of mine you know I love you so 
I wanna take you all around the world
Don’t you know good woman really hard to find
Wife of mine you know you look so sweet 
I wanna kiss you down to your feet
All o' di empress ah they look so right
From the first time at the corner shop where I met you girl
Then and there I knew it was love

This is what I tell them, this Princess she's mine
True love shall forever and ever prevail
