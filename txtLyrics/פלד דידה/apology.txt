Sorry little guy / You don’t deserve to die
Today was not your day / To come outside and play
And if there is a God / And He forgives our sins
I hope to be absolved / I won’t do it again
Feel your eyes closing / No sorrow in your mind
No more pain or suffering / No need to run and hide
If it’s any consolation / You know I’m just like you
For all my thoughts of freedom / My feet are trapped in glue
There will be a day / With sunshine in the sky
When men and mice will play / Til then sorry little guy
