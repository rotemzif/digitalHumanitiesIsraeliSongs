when I wanted you said no
now you want but I am gone
I don’t play these games no more
I gave you love 
you gave me war
I asked for trust you turned your back!
I don’t play these games no more
but it doesn’t mean you had to hurt me so bad
I still believe we have a chance so don’t give up so fast
didn’t know what was right for me back then
I was too young
babe girl I wanna kiss you
make me wanna  touch you
every time  around you
I am glad that  I found you
you are the reason for my smile
you are the reason for my style
I will walk 100 miles just to meet you for a while
talk to you
sit with you
babe even sleep with you
I am glad I kick with you 
cause I feel good with you
I wanna let you know
I will never gonna let you go
you are worth more than gold and I think it says it all
babe maybe we should take it slow
or babe maybe we should let it go
No!
see your picture in my head
every night in my bed
memories of things we did
so many years ahead
promise I will  stop playing games
just give me more time
more time
when you wanted I said no
now I am in but you are gone
you don’t play these games no more
you gave me love
I gave you war
you asked for trust
I turned my back
you don’t play these games no more
no more no more no more
oooooh
Sammy blaze don’t play
Sammy blaze stop playing
Sammy blaze don’t play these games no more
Now you see my picture in your head
every night in your bed
memories that we shared
will last forever
