Well I'm blue 
Does there have to be a reason 
Ain't nobody stealing me 
This time 
I'm alone in my crime 
Yeah, I'm blue 
So I sit and watch Pulp Fiction 
Wonder what the dictionary defines 
I'm alone in my crime 
Clay pots clang in silent unison 
Lace your fringe boots 
oh my baby 
Get ready to walk on, won't you walk on 
Cause the bass 
walks a funky rhythm 
Eminates beneath my feet 
Blue sky bound for fortune 
And rumours told 
in chinese whispers 
There's a lone fly, 
in his silken web 
Blind shepherds roam my home 
Mr Moon, between me and you 
This sky, this sky 
And promise me 
Promise me love 
Drifts by... 
Well I'm blue 
And I wear it like a cloak 
Like the poor man spoke 
It's in his eyes 
He's here too 
Yeah I'm blue 
On this frayed 
and desperate morning 
Paper snakes all torn in 
Sheets so fine 
Up the ladders I'll climb 
Cause the bass 
walks a funky rhythm 
Eminates beneath my feet 
Blue sky bound for fortune 
And rumours told 
in Chinese whispers 
There's a lone fly, 
in his silken web 
Blind shepherds roam my home 
Mr Moon, between me and you 
This sky, this sky 
And promise me 
Promise me love 
Drifts by... 
I'm blue...
