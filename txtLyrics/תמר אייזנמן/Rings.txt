Buying stuff to remember 
And I'm trying out just to live 
I'm talking much, to get tired and sleep 
Something's don’t mean 
I'm holding you back forever 
Happiness comes around every eight days 
Set me to be loved the right way 
Set me right. 
You want to quit I need rings 
You can feel everything 
I can't reach 
I wanna be here 
I wanna be here 
Now the sun comes up on you… 
I'm taking time up to the limit 
And I'm facing the life I don't want 
Love me after all our troubles 
Forgive me 
Cause some things they don't mean 
You want to quit I need rings 
You can feel everything 
I can't reach
