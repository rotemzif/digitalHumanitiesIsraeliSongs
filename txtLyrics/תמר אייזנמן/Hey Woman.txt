Hey woman 
Look at me now 
Because I got to the point where I can't look back 
And I got to the spot where I can't get enough 
Now I got to the place where it all makes sense` 
Hey woman 
Look at me now 
Because I know what you want without looking back 
And I found what you need I know what you thought 
See I got to the stage now it all makes sense 
I just wanna hold you now 
Hey woman 
Stick with me now 
Because I'm opening things I couldn't before 
And I feel like a ship sailing to shore 
And I'm back in the place where it all feels safe 
Hey woman 
Feel with me now 
Because I got on my feet I'm off of the floor 
And I got on my side away from the door 
And I got to the place where it all makes sense now 
I just wanna hold you now 
Hey woman 
Look at me now 
Cause I got what you want without looking back 
And I found what you need I know what you thought 
See I got to the stage now it all makes sense 
Hey Woman 
Feel with me now 
Because I got on my feet I'm off to the floor 
And I got on my side away from the door 
And I got to the place where it all makes 
Sense now 
I just wanna hold you now
