The clock ticks 
Lovers fly 
I can stay high or I could hide 
With all this love running towards me 
With all this passion in my mind 
I can stay like this forever 
If I’ll remember 
Inspired by true events 
Opened up my window let the air move in 
The season change from blue to gray 
It caught me by surprise that I just found 
That I could love that way again 
I opened up the window let the air move in 
I’m hurting on the inside but I’m seeing 
It clear 
And it doesn’t really matter what will 
Happen 
And it doesn’t really matter what just did 
Cause i'm satisfied with what I see 
The clock ticks 
Lovers fly 
I can stay high or I could hide 
With all this love running towards me 
With all this passion in my mind 
I can stay like this forever 
If I’ll remember 
Inspired by true events 
Then I took the fast way just to see you girl 
Driven by the passion in my mind 
55 minutes, two years, my whole life 
To realize that all of this was wrong 
Then I took the fast way and now I see me girl 
I’m a looking king of older but i’m not 
Afraid to fall 
It doesn’t really matter what will happen 
And it doesn’t really matter what just did 
Cause I’m satisfied with what I see
