You disappointed me so much 
And It hurts me too that I don't love you any more 
And you, you took the wrong road 
You walked too much roundabout 
People thought you had something great 
But, no no noâ€¦. 
There is nothing great about you, you're just something else 
Cause I, I gave you so much 
And don't forget where you are coming from 
Strangers gave you things, there's nothing like the real thing 
And I gave you so much. I don't forget, no I can't forget 
And I'm that stranger too, sometimes. 
Cause I gave you so much 
And don't forget where you are coming from 
Strangers gave you things, there's nothing like the real thing 
You disappointed me so much 
And It hurts me too, that I don't love you any more
