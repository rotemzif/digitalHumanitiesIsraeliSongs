Don’t take away my sun 
Take away what once I called home 
Don’t take away my light 
Take away the brighter days I once knew 
Don’t take away my life 
Take away my love I’ve never met 
Don’t take away my shining knight 
Take away my sight take away my tide 
All this time I thought I could get away 
All this time I thought I could get away 
Don’t take away my tries 
Take away what’s left from all I wondered 
Don’t take away my sky 
Take away the laughters I forgot all about 
All this time I thought I could get away 
All this time I thought I could get away 
Don’t take away my trust 
Take away my heart 
Take away my truth 
Take away the lies 
Take away these eyes I’ve fallen into
