Home, is a bottle of wine 
Slow, down life is to start over all the time 
Swing; Take a ride its jazz over again 
Free, that word should be expelled. 
Why did they put these fences up? 
All they do is hook my cut. 
Don’t anyone blame us for that. 
We want peace to be a fact. 
Oh I don’t wanna be 
Someone already existing, oh let's start creation from the top. 
Boom, Shaboom boom kaboom means so much to me 
Rules, what the fuck are they? And who should we sew? 
Me, Is another word for you 
Fate, A text message we erase 
Why did they put these fences up? 
All they do hook my cut. 
Don’t anyone blame us for that. 
We want peace to be a fact. 
Oh I don’t wanna be 
Someone already existing, oh let's start creation from the top 
Stop, pulling up 
Fences to our hearts 
Stop pulling up 
Stop, blaming us 
Home is a bottle of wine 
Wine is a bottle of grapes 
Its time for creation
