Faces getting cloudy, we haven't talked for weeks 
Something else gets you going now and it's not me. 
You don't deserve me like I thought you do 
In moments it could happen, but you don't let it. 
every place I go, it seems you're there 
and every walk I take, it feels you can follow 
Almost everyone knows 
you made this like this 
Defenses are up and nothing can bring them down. 
Every walk I take it feels you can follow 
But it could be different, I know 
But you got so much to find out first. 
And I can't be brave for you 
Fill your own tank of fuel 
And burn yourself down 
Just like you burned your friends. 
Our faces are so cloudy 
You haven't talked to me in months 
You got someone else that get's you going and it's not us. 
Every place I go, it seems you're there 
and every walk I take it feels you can follow 
but it could be different.
