Day and night I will follow our chance for a better life 
Day and night I will treasure every second from what is good 
Day and night I will hold on to you 
Day and night I will dance with your thoughts 
Day and night I will work to keep it good enough 
Every sunrise every set down day and night 
I will hold on to you 
The bottom line is drawing two 
Colors making new we are few 
And they are free 
But hold on to me 
In the rain don’t slip away 
If we’ll need we’ll drive far away 
All day long and into the night too 
Just to hold on to you 
Day and night I will sing your song for when you’re blue 
Day and night I will hold on to you 
I will lighten up your view when it gets black 
Day and night I will hold on to you 
The bottom line is drawing two...
