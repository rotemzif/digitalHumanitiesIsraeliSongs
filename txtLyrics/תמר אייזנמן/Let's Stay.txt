Let this music unite us 
Let this rhythm move us 
Let this love survive 
I love you a lot, is that enough? 
Forever We'll be togetherI can 
feel it in my bones 
But it's not working you must admit 
It's not working you must admit 
After all, after it all you are 
my everything and I'm yours 
So, let's stay until we find our way 
I know It's for the best 
We need each other love wine and air 
let's stay until we find our way 
I know It's for the best 
We need each other love wine and air 
(Let this music unite us) 
After all, after it all you aremy everything and I'm yours 
But it ends now, almost before it starts 
I love you the best 
But want to go and search 
and find everything you taught me 
and find everything you showed me 
So, let's stay until we find our way... 
I love you a lot, is that enough?... 
(Let this music unite us) 
(Let this rhythm move us) 
(Let this love survive) 
let's stay
