After I left you I just learned to adore you real good 
There's no solution got to go with the program 
and the proccess of feeling true 
I know that you know that I'm carrying up the both of us 
while leaning on your back confronting all we never had 
we never had, we never had, we never had... 
After I told you I needed some time to feel good 
There's no confusion got to deal with the concept 
and the meaning of being true 
I bet that you gave up on doing this for both of us 
while leaning on your back confronting all we never had 
we never had, we never had, we never had... 
Hit me, Hit me, Hit me home run 
Hit me, Hit me, Hit me home run 
Hit me, Hit me, Hit me home run 
Hit me, Hit me, Hit me home run 
After you broke down, didn't know what will come out 
Is this good !? common baby is this good !? 
Couse there's no improvement got to go with the 
movment and the decision of being true 
I guess that I'll help us by doing this for both of us 
while leaning on your back confronting all we never had 
we never had, we never had, we never had... 
Hit me, Hit me, Hit me home run... 
After I left you I just learned to adore you real good 
There's no solution got to go with the program 
and the proccess of feeling true 
I know that you know that I'm carying the both of us 
while leaning on your back confronting all we never had 
I know that you know that I'm carying the both of us 
while leaning on your back confronting all we never had 
I know that you know that I'm carying the both of us 
while leaning on your back confronting all we never had 
Hit me, Hit me, Hit me home run
