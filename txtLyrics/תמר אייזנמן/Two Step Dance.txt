I want to dance my 2 step dance 
Everyone knows we don’t fall when we dance alone 
I’ll take the lead and when I look away 
I’ll be that shy gorgeous girl for me to steal 
I step to the court I’ll vote and then I’ll draw 
It will be a waltz but I will be a 4 
They’ll stare I smile and horn 
That’s how I dance my 2 step dance alone 
Here I go 1, 1, 1 one is the only way out 
2, 2, 2, two is just a cure for love 
The melody is crazy, I lost count of touch 
The dance floor is heavy I’m the clown in the yard 
Move like spring flowers and I’m kissing the mist 
The music stops and then like a train it leaves 
Heading to the next station 
making room for my 2 step encore 
Here I go 1, 1, 1 one is the only way out 
2, 2, 2, two is just a cure for love 
I rely on light to feed us 
And now they’re all gone 
I finish the dance softly and take myself home 
I’m thirsty; I’m tired as I walk alone 
Here I go 1, 1, 1 one is the only way out 
2, 2, 2, two is just a cure for love
