If I could take you, you know that I would 
Someone else loves you the way that I should 
Why won't you take me back to your arms 
For just on more minute before I run out 
This is my kind of nothing going on 
I'm trying to catch you, you're fast as a cat 
They told me about you, but I don't mind 
If you're over a million and I've loved only one. 
This is my kind of nothing going on
