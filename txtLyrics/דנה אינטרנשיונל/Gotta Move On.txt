Gotta move on, gotta move on and, gotta move on and on 
Just little bit of action 
Just a little reaction on 
Carry on 
Gotta move on 
Gotta go on and on 
Just a little of nowhere 
Just a little of somewhere on 
Carry on 
Gotta move on 
Gotta go on and on 
Just little bit of action 
Just a little reaction on 
Carry on 
Gotta move on 
Gotta go on and on 
Just a little of nowhere 
Just a little of somewhere on 
Carry on 
Gotta move on 
Gotta go on and on 
My momma says if you get things done 
You better not mess with it 
My momma says if you get things done 
You better not mess with it 
You better not mess with it 
Gotta move on, gotta move on and, gotta move on and on 
Just little bit of action 
Just a little reaction on 
Carry on 
Gotta move on 
Gotta go on and on 
Just one day to love you 
Just one day to leave you on 
Carry on 
Gotta move on 
Gotta go on and on 
My momma says if you get things done 
You better not mess with it 
Gotta move on, gotta move on and, gotta move on and on 
Gotta move on, gotta move on and, gotta move on and on
