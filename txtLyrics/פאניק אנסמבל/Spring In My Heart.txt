Under the tree 
the sun is climbing high 
I open up 
to you my butterfly 
winds of seduction around us 
leaving my seeds 
under your wings 
under the tree 
the sun is shinning bright 
colors of lust 
they tingle in my eyes 
time drops falls down on my petals 
leaving the wide 
open fields behind 
oh-bearing my life without you there 
under the graceful moon 
I will carry on 
with the memory of your whispers 
spring in my heart 
under the tree 
the bitter ending night 
I'm closing down 
On you my butterfly 
Dance so the stars will remember 
Fluttering light 
On your last flight
