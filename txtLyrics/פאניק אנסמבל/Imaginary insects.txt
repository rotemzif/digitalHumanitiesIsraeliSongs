On days they had arranged to meet
he would sometimes wake from a dream
that he had been spread with honey
and now could not escape the flies.
Those nights they had agreed to meet
She would immerse herself in cream
She would win him with her softness
And he'd be locked withing her thighs
For hours after he would catch himself
flicking them away
imaginary insects.
Why she was so hungry for his presence
was a riddle "lady' he wants to shout
'It's over can't you let it rest
It's over can't you let it rest"
For hours after he would catch himself
flicking them away
imaginary insects
