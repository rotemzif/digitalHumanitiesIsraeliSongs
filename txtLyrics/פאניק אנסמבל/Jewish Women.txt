they always do it 
those jewish women 
promise you everything 
then cut off your head 
wine and cheese 
and all that teasing 
and you can be sure 
those jewish widows 
know how to please 
we always do it 
we jewish women 
cut off your head 
and then celebrate 
and complain 
about the mess 
the dirty Assyrian head 
makes rolling across 
their clean clean floors
