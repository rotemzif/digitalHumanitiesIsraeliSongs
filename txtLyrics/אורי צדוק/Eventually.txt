Dreams are faith for broken lives
My dreams became my torture
Did, I create you in my mind 
And if I scream will you not fall down
Liars awake in darkness
And there is no air in the sea inside 
I'm afraid hold my hand
The moon will follow the sun to dawn
There is no tomorrow from the day that you've gone
You showed me my heart
But you will break it eventually
Eventually
Every feather hits the ground
You wake up â€“ I go down
go down
I live twice every memory
