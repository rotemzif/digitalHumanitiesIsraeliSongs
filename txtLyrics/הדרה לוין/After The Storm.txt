So many heartaches & a fallen star was missing on the way 
You thought you could own me, 
with just the right tune and a pretty thing to say 
Pushing me on and on, covered with sweat, the roads keep playing 
I couldn’t let go of you, and yet, I was saying: 
Sorry I hurt you, but sometimes you need 
to settle for the better hand and I 
had to unease you, don’t take it too hard, I had to be looking 
And there’s a wave that’s calling, playing me hard and loud 
Tossing me about, my heart keeps cracking, it keeps on breaking apart 
I see the rainbow, knocking at my window 
standing in the way of the dark 
playing hard to get with my heart 
Walking in miracles 
The arrows you poisoned were constantly missing my heart 
My River was flowing 
And yesterdays’ grace was heavily hid in the dark 
A barefoot girl is walking 
Soaking wet dress, mud painted face, and a trace 
of long love-drunk nights 
Holding wounded visions & withered flowers in her hand 
After the dark storm comes the shattering calm 
Crispy bright light shines on 
it only cuts deeper in the sad eyes looking for home 
Everyone wears the skin that one bears, or else, trying to get by 
Cold bottled water, struggling accents and palaces cutting the sky
