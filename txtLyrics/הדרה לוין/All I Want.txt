I believe in love 
Just as long as love believes in me. 
I guess I really did mess up 
Just everything we had 
I guess we had to take it 
Just as long as we had 
But I think it's going all right now 
If you just let me be 
You make me feel 
So endless 
Time & again I wanted to kill you 
Time & again I wanted to please you 
Time & again now... Time and again 
And I'm risking 
Sort of twisting 
Sort of letting it go 
And I hope it will flow 
Like a ball of snow 
I know that when you were looking 
I was never around 
You probably won't trust me 
But I was out of my mind 
You must have known me forever 
You let me in your heart 
See I've changed, now you found me 
I'm doing something right 
Time & again I wanted to kill you... 
I'm putting myself on the line here 
I'm drawing the sketch of my soul 
And I'm letting you know what I know 
And I'm risking 
Sort of twisting 
Sort of letting it go 
And I hope it will flow 
Like a ball of snow 
Time & again I wanted to kill you... 
I believe in love 
Just as long as love believes in me
