I’m in the mood, I’m in the groove, I’m in the move 
for love, my mind is burning 
As soon as I got close to you, you turned around 
& said you won’t be calling 
I sounded crazy, I just love the way you call me 
oh pretty baby 
I used to be your number one, but I was dropping fast 
to number Fucking-Maybe 
And dig this too, ain’t nothing here 
that’s really over you. Over you 
I still get jealous when a girl is hanging 
round your skies in blue 
I want to see this Ryan Adams show 
and get real wasted (over you) 
With bits of fat and lips and smile and brain 
and all your funny faces (too) 
And how about me actually becoming a musician 
Starring at my own bewildered dreams 
became my holy mission 
And dig this too, ain’t nothing here... 
Now who’s that pretty girl, how old, how cold 
how under-paid, or laid, who is she 
You know tomorrow’s no one’s land 
I wish today could bring it all so easy 
And just one more before you go 
another radio station called me 
They said they loved my latest song 
with you, so solid, sharp and horny 
And dig this too, ain’t nothing here...
