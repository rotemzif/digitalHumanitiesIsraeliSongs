The minute you go is the minute I know 
I lost your love forever 
The minute you go is the minute I know 
I had your precious splendor in my hand 
O Baby, don’t go, please don’t go 
If this is your low tide, then I’m on the wrong side 
Hearing your pride beaten down... 
flat on the ground, wings flapping around 
you crying for help 
No one cares anymore, once a star once a whore 
No one covers your song 
No one’s rolling a stone. Get it into your head, baby 
Alone is alone is a lone! 
The minute you go is the minute I know…. 
And no body cares, as you’re falling from grace 
and the race keeps numbing your heart to the craze 
And no body listens, there’s no intermission 
the world keeps spinning, not easing your mind
