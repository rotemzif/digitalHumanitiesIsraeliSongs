You have been drained
 you don't think right you keep running with them
 so I call you once again but you don't see
 I'm not sure I intend to act according to your plans again not before the rain
And what if you'll get it lonely  I should have told you more but I couldn't hold the frame
 I've never heard you calling and I couldn't find the door
You have a mean brain you don't speak right but you keep calling their names
 and the bigger it gets the less you see
 the rest of this emotion is just a substitute for your beliefs
 for your oldest grief
And what if you'll get it lonely  I should have told you more but I couldn't hold the frame
 I've never heard you calling and I couldn't find the door
You have seen fame you must be right for all this will pay and I'll give you everything I'll kill your pain I'm not sure I intend to act according to your plans again not before the rain
And what if you'll get it lonely  I should have told you more but I couldn't hold the frame
 I've never heard you calling and I couldn't find the door
