Blue birds are flying on the ground. 
Make no sense when you're down. 
Take no place when the sun's shining on your face. 
True words are never to be said. 
You'd rather put a smile instead. 
Just before your brain is fed with a foolish thought again. 
Blue birds have no wings at all it's not the reason why they fall 
from the sky when you crawl. 
And there is nothing you can do for all the birds you see. 
Place them on the tallest tree. 
Take a step back to be free. 
Walk away butterfly, sailing over seas far away. 
Walk away pretty fly, floating in the deep far away. 
Blue birds are always on the run. 
Have no meaning have no fun. 
From the morning until the dawn in search of shelter. 
Maybe I can save them all, some of them will surely roll 
when the wind will start to blow. 
Walk away butterfly sailing over seas far away. 
Walk away pretty fly floating in the deep far away.
