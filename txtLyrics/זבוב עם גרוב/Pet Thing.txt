Things hasn't been easy lately 
All this talk of she loves me – well she don't 
But I gave up before, now I know what you're going to say. 
If you say: 
You're too nice to be me lover 
I just love you sweetie as a brother 
A pet, Well, I think I'll call my mother 
Tell her "would my sister stop bothering me" 
You know this is what I am darling 
I'm cute as a puppy, I won't bite 
So I'm sure that you'll take advantage, 
you're not really my friend. 
If you say… 
The conclusion of all this bullshit 
That I have to say "fuck off" for you all 
But you know my friend, somewhere I'll find 
someone fucked up like me. 
If you say…
