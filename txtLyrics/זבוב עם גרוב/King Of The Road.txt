Since the time I young, I always thought about speed, 
So I took out my toy car, and I drove out to the highway. 
In the moment I got there, 
all the drivers stopped and stare in respect, 
I can still remember that my parents were about to collapse. 
I'm a king of the road. 
I am riding, I am riding -where you riding to? 
When I came to the age I could register my license, 
I could see on the faces of my parents panic rising. 
All the shield and iron that they put on the car couldn't help, 
I put my hands on the wheel - and then 
I'm not out of control. 
I'm a king of the road. 
I am riding, I am riding -where you riding to
