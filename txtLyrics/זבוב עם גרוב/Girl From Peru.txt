I know this girl with flickering eyes 
She told me once she wants to die, 
But why? 
You've got, you've got, you've got to be glad 
You've got, you've got, you shouldn't feel sad 
Don't feel guilt for haven't done. 
She's got a soul you feel from a mile 
And a big smile to warm my heart 
How could I convince that beautiful girl 
That there is something worth living for. 
You've got, you've got… 
I hope those words would stay in your mind 
So each you hear this song you'll start to smile 
Forget about fucking suicide. 
You've got, you've got…
