Wasting all the summer, 
Smoking pot, drinking wine, having fun. 
So please forgive me for being silly, 
'Cause I don't want to be calm, in control in time. 
'Cause it's the time to arise, 
Like a never aging child, 
Put your mind off the line, 
Just this summer. 
'Cause it's the time to arise, 
Let the future wait awhile, 
Put good life on the line, 
Just this summer. 
What the rush, there would be more summers, 
You may ask, but I'll say only that, 
I'm saying goodbye my friends, I'm not leaving yet, 
But goodbye, is to leave memories of you behind. 
'Cause it's the time to ariseâ€¦
