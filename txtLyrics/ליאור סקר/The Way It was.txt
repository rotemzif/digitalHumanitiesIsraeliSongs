There is no way to go back 
Life is like a railway track 
can't go back 
There is no way to return 
To the place where I was born 
Can't return 
There is no way to go home 
And play my games until the dawn 
Those days are gone 
Maybe these are things you know 
That you've excepted long ago 
But for me it comes and goes 
Can't return 
Can't go home 
The past is gone 
There is no way to go back 
To feel a bit more wide awake 
Can't go back 
There is no way to feel love 
the way it felt when I thought of 
This certain girl 
Maybe these are things you know 
That you've excepted long ago 
But I had never felt assured 
the door is locked 
Can't go back 
Can't go back 
I just heard a song today 
Reminded of different days 
Long ago 
So much has been lost in time 
Most of us don't really mind 
Take me home
