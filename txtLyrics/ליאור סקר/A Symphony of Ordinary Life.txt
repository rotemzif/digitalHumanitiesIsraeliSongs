This is a symphony of ordinary life 
Nothing too grandiose or too loud 
This is the story of ordinary men 
Underachievers filled with pride 
And the words you hear 
Say what they mean 
And nothing more then that 
And there are no twists 
Or tongue in cheeks 
And the tune is plain and soft 
This is a symphony of an ordinary day 
nothing really happens most the time 
This is a symphony of moments lost in life 
That always seem to slip our minds 
And it's a celebration 
Of simplicity 
It's a whisper in a noisy restaurant 
It's an understatement 
filled with love for life 
It's a symphony of ordinary times
