Here it comes 
Night becomes 
A new day for you all 
But I'm half dead 
Gotta' get in bed 
Don't try to break my fall 
And all my days 
have their way 
To seem the same to me 
Like I'm trapped 
Tightly kept 
With no real entity 
Come with me 
Can't you see 
I'm restless and so bored 
Won't let me be 
I need to live it all 
I got up and 
Watched the clock 
it's almost midday now 
I forget which day just left 
And which one started now 
Come with me I can't be 
This way a minute more 
Stability is killing me 
I need to live it all
