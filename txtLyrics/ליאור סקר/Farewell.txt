And it's time to take what we have gathered 
And it's time to save what we have left 
Do not cry for both of us are happy 
Do not try to make us change our minds 
Do not cry there shouldn't be no sadness 
Do not cry for this is not an end 
There were times of tears and awful sadness 
There were times when we could not take more 
There were times things seemed to get better 
There were times when things could not get worse 
now's the time to step out of our doorstep 
now's the time to open brand new doors
