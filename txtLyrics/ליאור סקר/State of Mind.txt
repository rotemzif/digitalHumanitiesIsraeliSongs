Sitting on a branch , Playing my guitar 
And time just barely just barely goes by 
Over me birds fly 
Awaken from the sound 
I try (Try to get out of) 
This state of mind (To feel like I'm alive) 
Be here and now 
Resting in a field I tell myself again - "Do this more often" 
Time is slowing down 
feel like I can hold 
Hold it in my palm
