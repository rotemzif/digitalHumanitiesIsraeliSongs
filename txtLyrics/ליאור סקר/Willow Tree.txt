I'm a leaf upon at tree among many different ones 
As my life go and I grow I have learned to love the sun 
I'm a leaf upon a tree that is soaking up the sun 
Still my mind wonders again 
are there any brighter suns? 
On a branch upon the willow tree 
All the leaves are warming up in glee 
In the winter they will cease to be 
We are leaves upon a tree we are many different kinds 
As our lives go we grow and we're grateful for the sun 
We are leaves upon a tree in the winter we will be gone 
Catching the wind that will lay us 
upon the cold cold ground
