And this is how it would start 
a Few words aimed for the heart 
I'm slowly breaking apart 
I won't say nothing at all 
Just wait for this tide to turn 
I'll seem like my usual self 
But Inside I'm slowly losing my mind 
Don't ask how I feel today 
Or when will it go away 
You know it's too soon to say 
So I won't say nothing at all 
Just wait for this tide to turn 
I'll seem like my usual self 
But Inside I'm slowly losing my mind 
I won't say nothing at all 
Just wait for this tide to turn 
I'll look like I'm doing just fine 
But all the while 
I'm slowly losing my mind 
Are you still listening to me 
Was that to much misery
