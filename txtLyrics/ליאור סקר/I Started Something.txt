I've started something that went out of hand 
It's hard to remember just how it all began 
I was thinking of us when we started this game 
Each one so trusting 
Now things are not the same 
Started to walk down the path laid ahead 
Never to certain just where we would be led 
Slowly but surly our skins we have shed 
a small voice inside me 
Has turned to me and said 
Now I don't know who you are 
Now this has gone much too far 
Don't just drift on and on 
Don't let this game go on 
We've started something that slipped from our hands 
Could be that is the way it will remain 
Could be that one day it will be again 
If we could just remember the way it all began 
Now we don't know who we are 
Now we has gone much too far 
We will drift on and on 
And the games carries on 
But I could not see 
What was happening to me 
As the wind laid me down by the sea
