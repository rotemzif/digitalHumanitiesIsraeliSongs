Looks like now it's peaceful again 
Like an old familiar song refrain 
we're back on lane 
No dark clouds or blizzards in sight 
Rainy days has turned to quiet nights 
We're safe and tight 
All of us are happy again 
Looks like now it is our happy end 
brightly painted scene again 
Though these days might not stay the same 
Let's enjoy this happy end for now 
Brightly painted scene 
for now 
Sometimes we're not fully aware 
We just might not know 
when we get there 
it's so unfair 
All the times it slipped from our hands 
squandering the days of happy ends 
brightly painted scene again 
though this days might vanish away 
let's enjoy this happy day for now 
brightly painted scene 
for now
