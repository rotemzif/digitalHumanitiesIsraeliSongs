Started walking alone 
As the train carried on 
Though I'll catch me a ride 
On the other side 
But you can never be sure 
What the day has in store 
When you trust on your luck 
What might turn up 
So I looked up 
So the sky turn black 
Before I could turn back 
The rain was all over me 
I wished that I could be 
Back Home 
So I ran to the road 
But there was no way to cross 
And get to the other side 
And catch a ride 
So I caved in 
'cause that moment seemed 
Like there wasn't anything 
That could get me out of here 
I condensed all my fear 
And screamed 
Haven't felt this alive 
Before that moment arrived 
Must be this will to survive 
That Cleared my eyes
