I walked out my door 
To the freezing world 
I sang shattered words out in the cold 
Watching as the melody unfolds 
Black clouds filled the night 
Lightning sparked a light 
I just smiled and looked into the moon 
Hoping that the rain won't come too soon 
Oh my little one 
I am on the run 
But I don't know what it is to blame 
How I see myself or how I am 
Sleep now dearest one 
I will carry on 
Write a song to end a wasted day 
I'm just glad it came upon my way
