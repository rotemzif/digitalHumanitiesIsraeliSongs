We will teach you these songs of death 
Before you'll know any better 
Sit and listen to these words of hate 
You'll play your games a little later 
Songs of death 
Songs of death 
Let us teach you these songs of death 
And one day you'll die for us all 
then you'll join mother nature 
And you ma will look at your dolls 
And praise god for his grandeur 
Songs of death... 
Little child Swept away 
Everyone 'round you say 
That you must play along 
Raise your voice 
Sing the song 
I will teach you this song of death 
Before you'll know any better 
And in my eyes there's a sign of regret 
But you will forget it later
