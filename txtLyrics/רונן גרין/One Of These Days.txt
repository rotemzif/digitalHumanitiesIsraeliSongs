Ride around town
Chasing our tail
Looking for a dime
And maybe we'll be someone
One of these days its gonna happen to us
Peace will arrive and will all be as one
I know that's a fat cliché, it’s a well known fact
We do what we do and we just gotta do it right
One of these days
Music will go back to what it was
Before I and I became me and
me
One of these days its gonna come
You will wake up in the morning
Look up at sun and know
You've always been someone
One of these days
Ride around town
Chasing our tail
Looking for a dime
and maybe we'll be someone
Well if its alcohol and drugs to help us feel free
What was blocking us at the beginning to be?
One of these days
Ride around town
Chasing our tail
Looking for a dime
and maybe we'll be someone
