The bells are being rung by the wind
The dust is rising up to cover the seeds
Then the rain comes down to wash it all
And new life can spring
Well they talk about god, they talk about the lord
While everything is just the way it seems
The sun is going down, sky is getting pink
The moon is getting full and it looks like a ring
Then the next morning when the sun comes up
It feels like a dream
The sun keeps shining and the world keeps running
The sun keeps shining on our heads
The stars are filling the sky, they're filling the sky
Same for you and I
The lightning shows the way
Thunder shaking the ground
Then the rainbow comes when the work is done
Its like magic for the young
The bells are being rung by the wind
The sun is going down, sky is getting pink.
The stars a filling the sky, they're filling the sky
Same for you and I
