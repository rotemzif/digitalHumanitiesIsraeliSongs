It's been raining in my heart 
She's been so close to me 
A secret for a secret 
A heart for a heart 
It's been blazing in my soul 
She'd almost made me whole 
A rare connection 
With baggage to go 
Try to get by 
Try to get by 
Things around you, try to get by 
When you're alone, you learn to live on your own 
You get used to keeping it inside 
When you're finally two, you adjust yourself into 
Being another part of 
Just to get by (life) 
Just to get by (life) 
Things around you, try to get by 
When it's all over and your back home from love 
You learn again to live with lack of 
And the mind clears up and your soul starts to mend 
The pieces of your heart 
Just to get by 
Just to get by 
Things around you, try to get by 
Just to get by 
Try to get by 
Things around you, try to get by
