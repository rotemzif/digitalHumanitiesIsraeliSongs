You gotta know 
When it’s time to let go 
You gotta know 
You gotta know 
When it’s time to let go 
You gotta grow 
You gotta grow 
When it’s time to let go 
A spunge of love 
A brush of laughter 
A soap for anger 
You gotta know 
When it’s time to let go 
You gotta know 
You gotta know 
When it’s time to let go 
You gotta grow 
You gotta grow 
When it’s time to let go 
A drop of water 
rains and saves you 
from me.
