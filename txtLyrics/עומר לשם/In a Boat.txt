Three of us, in a boat 
Down streamin', what a float 
With my rain and his mice 
And the other guy's advice 
“I still miss you today), I say 
They let out a sigh and they die 
One of us, in a boat 
Up streamin', taking notes 
With a blister on my finger 
And lonely thoughts hung out to linger 
“I still miss you tonight), I shout 
Tomorrow I'll miss her, no doubt 
And I'm not sure if it's true 
What to do? 
with my heart 
For a start. 
“I still miss you tonight), I shout 
Tomorrow I'll miss her, no doubt
