A rock shaped heart 
Was found with me 
Unknown knowledge 
Surprisingly 
Eager moments to touch the pain 
You open the box I can breathe again 
Eager moments to touch the pain 
You open the box I can breathe again 
I can see the places true 
Can you hark a morning zoo? 
The oozing substance in my heart 
Became at once, a liquid start 
All afraid to finger the rain 
Afraid inflicting self soul drain 
I can see the places true 
Can you hark a morning zoo? 
I can see the places true 
Can you hark a morning zoo? 
All I see is painted hue 
And I can hark a morning zoo with you 
All I see is painted hue 
All of this in due to you 
All of this in do to youâ€¦
