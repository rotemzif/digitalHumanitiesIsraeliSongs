I woke up today, 
It was a brand new day 
It was a secret day 
It was a secret day 
That I woke up into 
But no one knew about that day 
Everyone’s sleepin, 
And not knowing 
Such a brightly day for fun 
I went into houses playin’ around 
No one will ever know 
No one will ever know 
She will never know.
