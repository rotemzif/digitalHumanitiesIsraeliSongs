Butterflies fill me inside and around 
the thought of you makes my heart feel drowned 
In a pool of passion and excite 
But I got my blood here at fright 
Goodness could come out of this 
Blend with it and don't be missed 
Grounded are my thoughts of clay 
Help them mold in a better way 
Love you if you will 
Don't let my heart be still 
Let it fly above to the greatest height 
Free yourself from the demanding light 
If I give, I think you'll take 
But will you give for me, is it fake 
Grounded are my thoughts of clay...
