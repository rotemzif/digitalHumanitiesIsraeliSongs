You are world famous, 
You are the everlasting soul 
Which I try keeping all for my self 
You are the infamous requiem. 
You are left out 
You are the logical of which I see 
You are the backhand, The twilight sonnet 
The killer bee. 
You are sound asleep 
You are my scenery of prophet 
You were the last signature 
The everfading guide.
