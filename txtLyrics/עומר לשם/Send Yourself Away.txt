Sailing on the greens of sand 
Reaching out with my left hand 
A hoot on a fruit and its gone all bad 
Left I was on the grinding wheel 
Right, I told the major seal 
A root in the boot and its gone all bad 
Lactose intolerant and itâ€™s fun 
Smear a truth and then run 
Some paint on a saint and its gone all bad 
Drilling my grounds of pain 
Freeing my soul to gain 
Some rain on a sane and its gone all bad 
Clearing the place inside 
breaking a glass and hide 
A name to a frame and its gone all bad 
Wearing it out again 
Never leaving it out again 
A blast to the past and its gone all bad 
Let it take you as it may 
Let it place you astray 
Send yourself away 
Send yourself away 
Sailing on the greens of sand 
Reaching out with my right hand 
A mute to your flute and its gone all bad 
A mute to your flute and its gone all bad 
Let it take you as it may 
Let it place you astray 
Send yourself away 
Send yourself away
