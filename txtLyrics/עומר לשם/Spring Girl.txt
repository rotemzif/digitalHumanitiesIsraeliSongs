Spring, came so suddenly on me 
Bouncing free, secretly 
Spring, how do you do? that thing you do 
Up and down, I want you 
Spring girl, are you hearing my call ? 
I'm up on the wall, don't mind if I fall 
Spring girl, what a killer bee you are 
I can't believe, I made it this far 
You have gone too far with my feelings - she said 
You've been reckless with my heart 
No more no more, I'll put out my stop sign now 
Thank you very much, No trespassing 
Spring girl, bouncing hard, hitting walls 
Stinging words, flippin' birds 
Spring girl, where are you, I ain't coming through 
Now I bounce like stones, breaking my bones 
Spring girl, I'll sing you a song, it won't do ya no wrong 
It won't do you no wrong, if I sing you a song
