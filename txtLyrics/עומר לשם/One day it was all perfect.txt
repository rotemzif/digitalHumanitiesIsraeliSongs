One day it was all perfect 
One day everything was good 
One day we burnt the circuit 
And now I guess I should 
On a long reviving night 
We struck moonlight on a sun 
One day it was all perfect 
But now it’s just no fun 
One day clicking on it made it better 
One day it almost dried 
Another fell from rainbows 
But now it’s classified 
One day the muscle tore 
One day it meant no more 
One day it was like a moment 
and now we’re forced to forfeit 
One day it was all perfect 
Such a useless sonnet. 
One day it was all perfect 
One day it was all perfect
