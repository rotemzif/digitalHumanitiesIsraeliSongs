We've shared a lifetime 
We've shared a love 
We've also shared the bedtime 
We've been above 
We've been lost and found 
We've been dog-gone-round 
Somtimes we sunk so deep to sea 
And now you've left me to flee free 
And I can't say i wanted you 
I can't say i needed you 
to stay 
with me 
forever
