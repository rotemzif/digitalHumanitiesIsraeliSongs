Breathe, I can’t breathe 
When I wake up in the mid of night 
And no one’s around 
It’s so heavy 
This burden of mine 
Breathe, she can’t breathe 
Every single little drop of tear 
Is sliding down 
And it’s heavy on her 
This lack of love 
Breathe, he can’t breathe 
Every time he finds another way 
It closes right down 
And it’s heavy on him 
Adventure man 
Breathe, we can’t breathe 
When the missiles in the light of day 
All falling ‘round 
And it’s so heavy 
This time around 
Sleep, how can you sleep 
When your children in the dead of night 
Are falling in line 
And it’s so light on you 
This burden of mine 
And we lack a place to stay 
You’re burning up all the hay 
Ignoring all in your way 
Forgetting all that you portrayed 
I’m finally finding the words to say 
Breathe, I can’t breathe 
When I Wake up in the mid of night 
Choking by myself 
Rushing to the hospital 
To save what’s left.
