Adventurer, you are forever there 
Unexpected, You exhaust yourself doing it 
Rejected, Immerse yourself in to it 
Adventurer, you are forever there 
Adventurer, its time to be a bear 
And hibernate while the winter thaws off 
Adventurer, you are forever there 
Extreme, That’s what they call you 
A bit more than you’re worth 
Adventurer, you are forever there 
Adventurer, its time to be a bear 
And hibernate while the winter thaws off
