I can't get myself a rest 
Can't find myself any calm 
I won't stop myself, not even for one second 
I can't move myself from my way 
To the treasure 
All the time I'm busy 
To get myself a way to this treasure 
And all the time I'm busy 
To break myself thought 
Yea I'm gonna get your treasure 
Nothing can stop me now 
I'm gonna run to this treasure that you own 
Cause I know, only your heart 
Can cure my life 
I can't get myself the silence 
Not while I'm bitter 
I won't stop. Not even for 2 minutes 
And I'll never change my plans 
Every day I'm so busy 
I'm looking for some hints to get close 
And once again I lock myself 
Keep avoiding people 
So I can find my way 
To my treasure 
Yea I'm gonna get your treasure 
Nothing can stop me now 
I'm gonna run to this treasure that you own 
Cause I know, only your heart 
Can cure my life
