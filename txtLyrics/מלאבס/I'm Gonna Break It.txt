I'm addicted to words you're addicted to fashion 
I'm addicted to you, now I'm going to bed 
In a way I'm concerned but I still call you baby and shake my head 
I'm addicted to muse you are looking for problems 
Tell me when it became such an envy play 
If only I could pray, if only I could move 
I probably would 
You're going on and on 
I'm faking smiles and then turn 
You're going on and on 
Maybe I should go 
To other places 
To other meadows 
Find a new direction 
Maybe I should go 
Today it's a game but tomorrow will be there 
And all I can feel is Agnostic waves 
You know I'm dying for a thrill but all I see is just empty spaces 
You know I'm trying this for real but all you've got is the same old look 
And now I'm gonna break it 
Don’t ask me why - you name it – you know… 
Now I'm gonna break it 
Why? You name it – who's bleeding after all ? 
You're going on and on 
I'm faking smiles and than turn 
You're going on and on 
Maybe I should go 
To other places 
To other meadows 
Find a new direction 
Maybe I should go 
I'm addicted to words you're addicted to fashion 
I'm addicted to you, you are my stepping stone 
In a way I'm concerned but I still call you baby, my deceit is so real… 
I suppose I believe, I just want to make sure that 
Every time it's so close you'll be staying away 
Tell me when it became such an envy play babe 
If only I could move, if only I could be good - I probably would 
You're going on and on 
I'm faking smiles and then turn 
You're going on and on 
Maybe I should go 
To other places 
To other meadows 
Find a new direction 
Maybe I should go
