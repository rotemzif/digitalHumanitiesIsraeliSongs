Here I Stand Alone In The Rain 
Holding My Head And Closing My Eyes 
Thinking About The The Days You Were Here 
Things Will Never Be The Same I Know 
I'm Falling Down 
And There's No One Around 
Just A Whispering Pine 
I Want To Hold You Again 
I'll Do Anything For You Girl 
Just To Make You Feel Safe And To Get You Back Home 
I Miss You And I Hope You Are Well 
God I Want Her So Bad 
I'm Falling Down 
And There's No One Around 
Just A Whispering Pine 
I Want To Hold You Again 
I Want To Sing For You Again 
My Leftovers Crumbling Fast 
There's Nothing For Me Now I'm Floating In Air 
Waiting Calm My Body Is Numb 
Won't You Please Come Back And Stay 
Papercuts In My Hand 
I'm Falling Down 
And There's No One Around 
Just A Whispering Pine 
I Want To Hold You Again 
I Want To Hold You Again
