Oh no, don’t tell me we can never be there
Oh no, don’t tell we can never win 
Stop saying come down you’re a little dreamer 
and  I'll keep you in
Come closer, take to another places
Come close to me cause I never will 
Make sure you take it to the very special 
You know, this time its for real
You're insane but the way you feel 
Is more than I could ask for 
Now without you nothing is real
If you'll go I can never kill 
You know I'll lose my skill 
my name is written on your wall 
Baby I'm your deal
Don’t tell me it’s a new temptation 
Don’t send me look for a new believe 
My head is burning & I'll care forever 
Just keep me in
You're insane but the way you feel 
Is more than I could ask for 
Now without you nothing is real
If you'll go I can never kill 
You see I'll lose my skill 
Your name is written on my wall 
We're each others deal
You're insane but the way you feel 
Is more than I could ask for 
Now without you nothing is real
If you'll go I can never kill 
You know I'll lose my skill 
Your name is written on my wall 
Baby I'm your deal
