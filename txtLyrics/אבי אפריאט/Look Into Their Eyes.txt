As the days go by 
The sun is burning 
Fever is high 
No hope in the morning 
Around are little graves 
In the desert of death 
There are children to be saved 
Before they lose their breath 
Hold them Touch them 
Feel them as strong as you can 
Their babies die 
And their mothers cry 
Their lives will never be the same 
Look into their eyes 
Hear their heartbeat 
Don't let them die 
Look into their eyes 
Hear them crying 
When the night comes they reach for a hand 
Their looking for a friend 
The young and the old 
Wait for salvation 
Kept in their soul 
Dying of starvation 
Those who were left behind 
In the heat of day 
Hopelessly trying to find 
A shelter and they say: 
Hold us Touch us 
Feel us as strong as you can 
Our babies die And 
their mothers cry 
Our lives will never be the same 
Look into their eyes... 
And when you think 
There's nothing you can do 
When you think 
There's nothing you can say 
They need you! 
They need you! 
They need 
LOVE!!! 
Look into their eyes... 
Hear their heartbeat 
Don't let them 
die 
Look into their eyes...
