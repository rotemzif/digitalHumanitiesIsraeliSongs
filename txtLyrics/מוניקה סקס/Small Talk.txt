You like to bare your soul during small talk
Fascinate a stranger and walk
I guess we’re all entitled to a hobby
Meet me in the lobby, we’ll talk
Just talk.
I know these afternoons; I know them all too well
The sound of stirring spoons inside of coffee cups
You take it milk and two; correct me if it’s not enough
We can roll around later on
Like we used to, it was great
Don’t you know my love is never gone
It just changes into hate
Changes into hate
Tell me what is wrong; I’ll make sure that it goes on.
You like to bear your soul during small talk
Fascinate a stranger and walk
I guess we’re all entitled to a weakness
To a little sickness, let’s talk
Just talk
We can roll around later on
Like we used to, it was great
Don’t you know my love is never gone
It just changes into hate
Changes into hate
Tell me what is wrong; I’ll make sure that it goes on.
