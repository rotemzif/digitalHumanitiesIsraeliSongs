Run in circles 
try to catch a ride 
such a hopeless state 
lose your patience when you realize 
you’re like a live bait 
run, run, run around 
you won't feel like I’m there 
run in circles 
try to catch my breath 
on this battle ground 
wave my white flag 
now you know I’m done 
so give up what you found 
don't tell me what I know 
don't talk just let it go 
don't think it doesn't show 
don't
