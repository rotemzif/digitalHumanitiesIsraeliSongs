Nothing's happening in my world silence has made it her home
In the struck of lighting something caves my heart is alive after all
Show me your sleeve Show me its real I don't want surprises
What is your motive an inters in me is feeling kind of wasted
Show me how to live
Always seeking advice around the room when no one else is listening
Putting face of stupid acting smart is not the way to pool it of
Show me your sleeve Show me its real I don't want surprises
What is your motive an inters in me is feeling kind of wasted
Show me how to live
Sometimes it's clearer than now
Times I can open up my eyes
And sometimes it stings sometimes it hurts
