burning down all my angels
I'm breaking up that whole idea
There's no magic
I'm breaking up that whole idea
I'm so miserable,
and my guarding force unsuitable to protect me through the day
I'm not free at all,
and the vultures wait for me to fall, use my agony as prey
unpredictable,
on the verge of trying to to kill us all, and then leave without a trace
rain's washing the pavement
making room for something real
There's no danger
I'm making up the whole idea
I'm so miserable,
and my guarding force unsuitable to protect me through the day
I'm not free at all,
and the vultures wait for me to fall, use my melody as pray
unpredictable,
on the verge of trying to to kill us all, and then leave without a trace
