Losing you 
Silently 
Start to feel 
So... 
Silently soaking 
In a sudden heatwave 
All your signs were safe 
Pack life in a suitcase 
I'm a lost case 
You're just my illusion 
Made of my wet dreams 
It's all a confusion 
A diffusion 
Why do I have to beg 
for your heart? 
Emotion, 
Can you feel? 
So cold. 
Silently soaking 
In a sudden heatwave 
All your signs were safe 
I pack life in a suitcase 
I'm a lost case 
You're just my illusion 
Made of my wet dreams 
It's all a confusion 
A diffusion 
Why do I have to beg 
for your heart? 
With your sudden heatwave 
Where's you're...? 
All is safe and sound 
In my sudden heatwave 
Where's your love
