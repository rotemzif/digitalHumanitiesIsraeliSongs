When you will come with me 
Into my hell 
I will have to stay there 
While you can be anywhere 
Take me back to the land of time 
Take me back to reveal my crime 
Take me back to the land 
You’ll be in heaven while 
My angels dwell 
Find my way to get there 
I’d follow you anywhere 
Take me back... 
Hey you pretty boy I was just looking for you 
Say where 
I want to have what you share
