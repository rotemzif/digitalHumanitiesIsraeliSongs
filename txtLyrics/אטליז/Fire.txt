You have won what you wanted 
All I'm giving, 
You’re not the one 
Inside out shifting your doubts 
Ride your highways I’m not the one 
Now I get caught up in the sun 
Feels like fire 
Fire 
You have won what you hunted 
All I'm giving your not the one 
You are one with your moments 
All I’m giving now I must run 
How I get caught up in the sun 
Feels like fire 
You are one with your moments 
All I've given circles the sun 
Fire
