Where have you been
My whole life i was looking for you
Your pain, it's killing me
But i don't care to suffer for you
It's so hard for me
To start again
My beautiful friend
I am not gonna let you down
I'm strong now for both of us
I love you so
I love you so
My friend
I'm all alone
Missing you like hell
Take care
The life you've lived
makes me wanna win
It's so hard for me
To start again
My beautiful friend
I am not gonna let you down
I'm strong now for both of us
I love you so
I love you so
I love you so
I love you
My friend
I'm almost there
please smile for me again
