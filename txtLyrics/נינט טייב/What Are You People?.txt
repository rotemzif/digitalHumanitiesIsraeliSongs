what are you people running from
the end will stay there
for everyone
no need to fight
well i think you know the story well
pretending is only gonna make it
worse
please don’t pretend
teach me how to keep
my mouth shut
just for a while
teach me how to scream out loud
and..
yes, i hate the sunlight on my face
a global warming will only
make it worse
come rainy days
wash away my stolen nights
the gray cells out of my brain
‘cous pretending will only
make it worse
(come come rainy days)
teach me..
as fire cannot exist without the wind
i cannot exist without you
