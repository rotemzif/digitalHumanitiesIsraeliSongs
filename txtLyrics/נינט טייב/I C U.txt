I See you walking 
With your hand 
on the ground 
The road is taken by 
a dead-man alive 
He will convince you to
take that ride
I see you I see you  
I see you see
nothing else 
You're man's tongue 
is in another wet cave 
I see you see her see him  
You've got nothing 
to lose 
You've got something 
to prove 
You've got something 
he wants 
But she wants him 
between her legs 
Its 5:00 am and he 
ain't back yet 
Your heart is drifting 
and your hands are tight 
He will convince you 
you've lost your mind
I see you see her see him 
You've got nothing 
to lose 
You've got something 
to prove 
You've got something 
he wants 
But she wants him 
between her legs  
How low you can go
