I got some old records "Elton John"
So we can play it all night long and on
You like the music of that special song
I wanna hear you sing it, loud and strong and on
I got some friends over having fun
We're spinning 80's music till the sadness is gone
Neighbors calling cause it's way too strong
I need you now, you're not going home!
Turn up the volume, turn down the lights
Turn up the tempo and stop with the fights
Loving the atmo, loving the night
Turn up the volume and lets do it right
At dizzy heights, got my make up done
Ready to let it out like nothing's wrong at all
You like your thrills in showers raining down
I wanna see you happy feeling you belong
I kicked my girls out so we'll be alone
The place is empty now so you should join me for
Big old bed's a mess and I am pumped
I need you now , you're not going out!
Turn up the volume, turn down the lights
Turn up the tempo and stop with the fights
Loving the atmo, loving the night
Turn up the volume and lets do it right
You're easy going, I know you're easy going
I'm easy going too, together we can show it
You had a drink or two so everything is flowing
I'm easy going too so baby we canâ€¦
