i'm ruled by itching and cigarette ashes 
i keep discover where i least want to 
day is a way to pass the time 
but i rather avoid time these days 
more gaps between the lines 
and angels on t.v i don't understand 
i'm filing emotions like paychecks or the 
rent they seem no different anyway 
like genome research i pin the blackboard to the wall 
and chalk down all those goddamn squeakings 
in my soul 
day is a way to pass the time but i rather avoid 
time these days
