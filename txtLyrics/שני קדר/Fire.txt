slack down at my work at the coal mine 
and you won't fire me but will not pay for what i find 
i am not pretty and i can't smile 
i'm so quiet you would hear cars driving on top of me 
and everything's so easy when you're not with me 
stop wishing won't you start wishing 
don't you wish you were a part of a better demographic, 
wish you had a better starting point
