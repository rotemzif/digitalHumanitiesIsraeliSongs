i step outside of the door that he built to 
contain me inside 
and all i want is go back in 
see them waving their goodbye to me 
and i'll drink my wine and - 
i see my sons coming back from the war 
sit all still and silent and i know 
i'm the one who sent them there 
see them running fast and hard from me 
and i'll close my eyes and - 
i wait for you to come home all mad 
and won't say a word cause we don't 
wanna take it to bed 
but in the morning you'll feel better 
and i'll wake up with a headache
