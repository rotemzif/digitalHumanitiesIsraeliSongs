this city is more like a ghost to battle 
i kinda wish it would take me down 
to where i'm not supposed to be 
in the slums and the sleaze 
where all the cripple do not pretend they're not crippled 
i bet she goes to sleep naked 
i have spent too much time 
arching this back of mine 
the straight course is much more appealing
