when pressed against anything sharp 
gentle girl tissues tend to erupt 
a snow-flaked floor is up against my face 
oh why did i ever agree to this 
did you have to uncover whatever's left of my heart 
take the clich√© that is me and turn it into art 
cars downstairs like candydrops in flames 
and the phone sounds like a nymph screaming out your name
