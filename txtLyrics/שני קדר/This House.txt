everything flows downwards from the walls of this house 
goes flowing downwards from the walls of this 
like breaking a virginity or 
breaking out a floodgate a little bit more every day 
everything flows downwards from the walls of this house 
goes flowing downwards from the walls of this 
like losing a virginity or 
breaking out a floodgate a little bit more every day 
like soap bubbles my kitty tries to catch 
flowing downwards from the walls of this house 
going backwards to the graveyard of this house 
burning every single photo of being young 
and i'm young and i'm losing my mind
