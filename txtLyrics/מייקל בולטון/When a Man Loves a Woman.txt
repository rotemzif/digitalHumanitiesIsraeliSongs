When a man loves a woman 
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else 
He'd trade the world 
For the good thing he's found 
If she is bad he can't see it 
She can do no wrong 
And turn his back on his best friend 
If he puts her down 
When a man loves a woman 
I give you everything I've got 
Trying to hold on to your precious love 
And baby baby please don't treat me bad 
When a man loves a woman 
Deep down in his soul 
She can bring him such misery 
If she is playing him for a fool 
He's the last one to know 
Loving eyes can never see 
Yes when a man loves a woman 
I know exactly how he feels 
'Cause baby, baby 
When a man loves a woman
