"There's close to nothing left to eat besides of what has already been chewed. 
A 100 times before she took off from her chair down to the floor. 
look up a name.
Its all the same.
And when she's ripe, she'll tremble.
No one knows just where she's heading for but she ain't stopping."
Chorus:
Cause she was gorgeous, and she was ready to do all of the many things a gorgeous would usually do.
And she was gorgeous and she was ready to rule her whole existence in such gorgeousness no one would approve.
But everyone would like to be ... Gorgeous
There's a little place inside her mind she keeps for all those gorgeous things she never said before 
she's saving them for times there needed more.
look up a name.
Its all the same.
And when she's ripe, she'll tremble.
No one knows just where she's heading for but she ain't stopping.
Cause she was gorgeous, and she was ready to do all of the many things a gorgeous would usually do.
And she was gorgeous and she was ready to rule her whole existence in such gorgeousness no one would approve.
But everyone would like to be ... Gorgeous.
