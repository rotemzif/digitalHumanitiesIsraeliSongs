Fix me a condo, fix me a valentine fix me up with me up with the marlon brando
Fix me a bingo fix me a bungalow, fix me up with your mama's jello 
 I'm dancing on hydraulic gearing
Come teach me how to show a feeling
Lets hit rewind to keep us in the dark  
 It's a matter of a missing data                            
I'm working on magnetic radar
Proceeding but the night wont turn to day.... fare away  
It's late at night with the girls down town
I need a fix a fix a fix to get me around
So tell me your name and I might even believe
that you can fix me fix me fix this night, wont deceive 
Fix me a condo, fix me a valentine fix me up with me up with the marlon brando
Fix me a bingo fix me a bungalow, fix me up with your mama's jello 
I'm moving but my limbs are mental
Can someone call the toxic central?
I'm fading through a cosmic lullaby 
The night is at its darkest hour
i still don't know what I desire 
It's late at night with the girls down town
I need a fix a fix a fix to get me around
So tell me your name and I might even believe
that you can fix me fix me fix this night, wont deceive 
Fix me a condo, fix me a valentine fix me up with me up with the marlon brando
Fix me a bingo fix me a bungalow, fix me up with your mama's jello
