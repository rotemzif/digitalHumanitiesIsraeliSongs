Walking through town just the other night 
I thought I saw you just beyond my sight 
Spun around real fast, looked from left to right, 
Couldn't see nothing for the tears in my eyes 
It's been that way for quite some time 
Ever since the day we said goodbye 
I don't want you back but I can't get you out of my mind 
I gave you everything but you wanted much more 
I tried to hold on but you wounded my soul 
Treated me so bad 'till I let you go 
But I still think about you when I'm alone 
I know I was right to leave you behind 
I have no regrets most of the time 
I don't want you back but I can't get you out of my mind 
I don't want you back but I can't get you out of my mind 
When the sun came up my eyes were red 
My glass was half empty and so was my head 
You said one word as you shut the door 
My ears are still ringing with the sound of that "NO" 
Last night I dreamed that you came to me 
Asked to get back like we used to be 
Promised it'd be better just wait and see 
Woke up in a sweat, thanking god that I'm free 
I tell myself just to give it some time 
I'm happier now, I'm doing just fine 
I don't want you back but I can't get you out of my mind
