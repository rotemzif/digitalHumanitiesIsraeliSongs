Time  past loneliness 
We're stuck in the middle of maybe
Time past loneliness 
You got the power on me in your bed 
just in your bed
I'm losing  you
Losing  you
For the best of my circles
Time past loneliness 
We're stuck in the middle of crazy
Time past loneliness 
But I came back into your bed
Into your bed
You made me love me
You made me wonder why
Losing  you
For the best of my circles
