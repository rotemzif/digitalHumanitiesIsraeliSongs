Somehow I got myself into a loop
Like a trained circus tiger jumping
through flaming hoops
The minute I achieve a goal instead
of felling whole
There is a black hole
I find no rest al all.
Got to move on to a new day a new thing
From a far I hear machines
Going ehe ching ehe ching bling bling
Don't know if they call for me
But I have got to come closer to see.
Need to find someone that will show me the way
I feel so tired I've been at it night and day
Trying to crack the code for fortune and fame
Somehow I Have to take me game
To the next level.
Now that I'm here
No end I fear
When the game is almost over
I don't feel come out stronger
If anything, I grew weaker
What will become of me when
all has been achieved?
I've got to stay on track
Don't want to go down a level.
Need to find someone...
