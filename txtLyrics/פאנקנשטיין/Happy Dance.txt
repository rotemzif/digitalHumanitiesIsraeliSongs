Since the dawn of time
Or at least the dawn of groove
People have found a way to move
It’s a language we can't stand
Cause if we stand you can't understand
But the minute we break free
Of our day to day chains you see
It all comes so easily
I see you get what I'm talking about
So let's get down and shout
Funk you, everybody in the house
Raise your hands
Shake your bootie to release the stress
All you got to do is 
Take a chance
Feel the joy and do the happy dance
When the spirit of your dance is deep
You keep shakin' in your sleep
The best thing is when we all become one mass
That's what I call top class
A bunch of people, A whole bunch of people
A whole bunch
Crunch together
A whole bunch
Touch each other, dance together, feeling one another
Brush against, break a sweat, getting wet
Make a move, set the date
Who needs words to communicate?
It's time to get up, cause you don’t want to be late.
Funk you, everybody in the house
Raise your hands
Shake your bootie to release the stress
All you got to do is 
Take a chance
Feel the joy and do the happy dance
When the going gets tough, the tough go dancing!
