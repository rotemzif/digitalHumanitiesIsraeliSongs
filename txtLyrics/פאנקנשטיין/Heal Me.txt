Heal me now
Take me in
My soul is run down
Donâ€™t know where to begin
Treat my wounds
Get me clean
As soon as I'm ready I'm going back in
Take the time
There's no other way to stop this crime
My heart is bleeding every second I'm alive
Heal me now
Fill my need
I know why I've started
And it wasn't for greed
My day has come
Take the lead
My fighting is done
I got nothing to bleed
