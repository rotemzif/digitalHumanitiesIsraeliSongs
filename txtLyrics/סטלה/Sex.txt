I have enough room for another man 
I've seen to many bodies in my bed 
I'm getting close so close to redemption 
Not gonna stop till I get my meal 
While he's going in and going out 
I'm thinking about another man 
Who sent me yellow flowers 
And sucked my right foot 
Sex is my only way to feel loved 
I'm hungry for feelings 
And I pray and I pray 
While symphonies playing in my head 
I never knew compassion or regret 
Only shame 
I never get addicted to anything 
But I follow the dangerous lines 
My stomach grows to unbelievable size 
When I swallow men like ash 
It's getting nasty and disgusting 
It can never be forgiven 
I lie to find my way outside 
I hope it is forgotten 
You, you gonna get your shot of pain 
I'm going back to my defense 
And I pray and I pray...
