I held them tight 
Too tight to breath 
I killed my lovers 
With my heart beat 
Blow wind blow 
And take him away 
The sun goes down 
Ending the day 
Blow wind blow 
And take the pain 
The memories 
In my brain 
Don’t 
make a sound 
Don't even dare 
I'll cut your hair 
You'll fade away 
Blow wind blow 
And take him away 
The sun goes down 
Ending the day 
Blow wind blow 
And take away the pain 
The memories 
In my brain 
Don’t... 
I love the flavor 
Of this rotten fruit I eat 
Sweet bitter 
More bitter than sweet But 
every time I said I'm leaving 
He stopped me with his touch 
Touched my weakness 
I paid my sins 
I paid with tears 
To give myself back 
The melodies
