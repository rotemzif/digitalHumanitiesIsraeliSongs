She said to me: 
"Honey, please hold me when I fall" 
But I just can't see her when she's 
Down on the floor 
She looks at me with anger, saying: 
"No, I'm just sad it's not your fault" 
She's a mermaid in my dark soul 
Another prisoner of my love 
She's my bay I reach to get to 
With my tiny broken boat 
She said to me: 
"Baby I'm here I'm so close" 
But I was standing with my back to her 
I never meant to make you hurt 
I'm sailing in my broken little boat 
In my unknown ocean 
I'm looking for your lips in the fog 
I taste the tears on your hot red cheeks 
I yelled at her: 
"Honey, I'm too weak to be alone" 
When she was walking out the door 
But now that she's back I'm still alone 
I think my girl is gorgeous 
But in my ocean the waves are just too strong 
Well I'm sailing on my broken little boat 
In my unknown ocean 
I'm looking for your lips in the fog 
I taste the tears on your hot red cheeks 
My tiny broken boat 
In my unknown ocean 
I'm looking for your lips in the fog 
I taste the tears on your hot red cheeks
