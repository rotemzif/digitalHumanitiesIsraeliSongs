Don't just walk on by 
After you deceived me why? 
And I don't wanna say goodbye 
'Cause I don't want you to see me cry 
I put on my smile 
And all the crowd is waiting for me 
And I don't know what to do 
I wanna be with you 
To hear your voice see your smile 
Just wanna forget that you lied 
Don't just walk on by 
After you deceived me why? 
And I don't wanna say goodbye 
'Cause I don't want you to see me cry 
I put on my smile 
And every day that has past 
Gave me time to think 
Gave me strength gave me hope 
To start to believe in me 
But the pain won't walk away 
I chose a different way 
Because you lied 
Don't just walk on by 
After you deceived me why? 
And I don't wanna say goodbye 
'Cause I don't want you to see me cry 
I put on my smile 
And I won't cry 
I won't cry if it ain't justified 
And fuck the tires 
I'm gonna lose my mind 
I want to stay behind 
I don't want to define 
The feelings that inside 
Don't just walk on by 
After you deceived me why? 
And I don't wanna say goodbye 
'Cause I don't want you to see me cry 
I put on my smile
