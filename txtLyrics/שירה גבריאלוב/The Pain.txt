The pain will walk away
But I
I will ever stay, cause
When I'm devastated
Kiss me securely don't fake it
No one trusts me
And no one cares
Cause no one will love me
Love me today
And I'm OK
Say that I'm OK
If you'll stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay
I'll be OK
The sun is far away
But I 
I want to shout and say
That no one knows or pays
Attention for this game you play
But i want you to say
That you'll be ok
The sun will shine today
And i want you to say
Say...
And I'm OK...
Know you can't get it
Just if you want it
Now you can love me so
Cause if you'll get it
Then you will say it
And I won't feel secure
The pain will walk away
But I
I will ever stay, cause
When I'm devastated
Kiss me securely don't fake it
No one trusts me
And no one cares
Cause no one will love me
Love me today
And I'm OK...
