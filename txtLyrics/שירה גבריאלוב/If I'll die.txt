'Cause if I'll die
Will somebody cry?
And if you ask me to try
I pobably will
I'll say goodbye
From all those who tried
To love me again
From all those who can
'Cause if I'll die...
So I'll die
When you cry
Why do I
Try to be
Someone else
And no one knows that I am different
'Cause no one knows that I'm in pain
'Cause if I'll die...
Now I'll stop
'Cause I need to breath
Now I'll drop my act
I'm starting to live
I wish it's not in vane
All this pain
When you left with no goodbye
I just sat and cried
Didn't want for us
To be through
'Cause if I'll die...
Love me again
I hope that you can
