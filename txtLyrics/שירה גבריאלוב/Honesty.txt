Came back to an empty room
I was not supposed to lose this game
Take me back to our time together alone
I will not apologize
I've played your fools for a long long time
Tell me how to live by my own
Pretending I'm strong
I'm coming back to where I belong
I won't break now that you're gone
Took your things and run away
From our home
Promise me honesty
If you feel the same
Promise me honesty
Take me with you
Promise me that you'll be everything you say
And I won't give up and I won't give in
And I can't forget how I miss you
Came back to a place I thought I knew
Promises aren't meant to break us two
Pack my things I'm going to sail on my own
I have lost in pain I've cried out
Through this phase my life turned upside down
Now I'm learning how to be strong
I'm ending what's wrong
I'm coming back to where I belong
I won't break now that you're gone
Took your things and run away
From our home
Promise me honesty
If you feel the same
Promise me honesty
Take me with you
Promise me that you'll be everything you say
And I won't give up and I won't give in
Promise me honesty
If you feel the same
Promise me honesty
Take me with you
Promise me that you'll be everything you say
And I won't give up and I won't give in
And I can't forget how I miss you
I'm coming back to where I belong
I won't break now that you're gone
Took your things and run away
From our home
Promise me honesty
If you feel the same
Promise me honesty
Take me with you
Promise me that you'll be everything you say
And I won't give up and I won't give in
Promise me honesty
If you feel the same
Promise me honesty
Take me with you
Promise me that you'll be everything you say
And I won't give up and I won't give in
And I can't forget how I miss you
Promise me honesty
Promise me
