Hug me, trust me 
If you want you can love me
Kiss me believe me 
but don't ever think to leave me!
Hold me tight 
Together tonight 
Just tell me how you feel 
Go with the flow
Rock and roll, don't say it's not real.
You know you are one of a kind
 Just say that you'll stay
You know that I'm right 
Just say it's ok 
Look in my eyes and say that you'll stay 
You know that I'm right 
Just say it's ok 
That you'll stay…
Don't go,
Don't blink don't think
'cause you won't see me have to be near me 
Let's go let's show 
That our love is true 
That now I'm with 
You’re playing with me heart 
Now it's game over you 
Have to move closer....
you know you are one of a kind….
