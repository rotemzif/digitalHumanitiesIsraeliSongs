Tell me, was there something you did for the people
Who feel like the world is collapsing
Was there something you've said or done?
Ask them
Would they give up their lives for the freedom, 
The freedom of things to believe in 
Would they give up their children's lives?
Pieces, everything turns into pieces
Pieces, I am trying to pick up
But there already lost in my head
Changes, they are sneaking on you at your doorstep
They're good if you're willin' to make them
If you're ready to take that chance
Baby, would you come here and make me stop thinking
Stop saving the world in my mind now
'Cause what we all have is here and now
Pieces, everything turns into pieces
Pieces, I am trying to pick up
But there already lost in my head
For a moment, I see what this world could be
By the truth and serenity is bound
For a moment, I see the best part of me
If it is so good, then why does it keeps
breaking me down intoâ€¦
Pieces, everything turns into pieces
Pieces, I am trying to pick up
But there already lost in my head
Worries, worries will only get closer
Closer as far as we let them
'till the day that we'll drive them
