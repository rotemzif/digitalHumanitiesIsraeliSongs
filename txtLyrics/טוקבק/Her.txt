I'm seeing her 
Seeing her 
what can i say 
it just happened on day 
one ordinary cloudy day 
she came my way 
what can i say 
for all i know 
i don't want you to go 
for all i care 
i don't want to be anywhere 
but what can i say 
what can i say 
to make you stay 
I'm seeing her 
seeing her 
yes 
I'm seeing her 
cause she makes me feel 
unreal
