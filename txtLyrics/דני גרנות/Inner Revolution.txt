It’s heaven, just to walk this land 
You and me, hand in hand 
It’s heaven, when you smile at me 
Heaven is to be set free. 
No Government, no Constitution 
No armament, no pollution, 
No violence for self-protection 
No power trips for satisfaction 
Rain forest isn’t just a name 
Killing skills is not a game, 
Building jails, is no solution 
It’s time for inner revolution. 
Not you and me against the others 
For heaven’s sakes, aren’t we all brothers? 
Each one alone, deep in your heart, 
To look for bliss, that’s where you start. 
Heaven, is to be set free 
To watch your face smile at me, 
You and I, hand in hand 
Walking in the Promised Land.
