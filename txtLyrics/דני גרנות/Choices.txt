That can cut you like a knife, 
It’s the actions lovers take 
That can ruin each other’s life. 
It’s the blindness people face 
When they caught up in the race, 
It’s the trust that disappears 
And gives way to all the fears. 
I long to see the summer sun 
Beaming down on her face, 
Now I’m looking for anyone 
To take me from this place. 
We used to make love all through the night 
Not a single silly fight, 
Now tears running down my face 
I got to get out of this place. 
And the waves keep crashing down 
And her beautiful smile is just a frown, 
Is the melody of love really gone? 
Is it waiting for me just by the dawn? 
The melody of love was there all along 
You have to look with your heart, 
It’s just beneath this song 
It’s the choices lovers make 
That can cut you like a knife, 
It’s the actions lovers take 
That can bring you back to life.
