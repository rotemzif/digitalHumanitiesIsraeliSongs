I remember when we met, 
You were almost twenty-one, 
On your head a yellow hat, and your sweet face was red, 
From too much sun. 
Wonder where are you right now 
Are you somewhere helping injured birds to fly, 
What has happened in your life, are you still in love 
With the other guy? 
Then I met you once again 
You were almost twenty-four, 
Many things were on your mind; you had to catch a train, just like before. 
Time is moving by so fast 
Could you ever find a little time to stay? 
What’s the point in this life if you can never rest? 
A few hours in a day. 
Seasons passing like the wind 
I’ve been longing for your touch 
You were once in love with me, and me with you, 
I know this much. 
Now together in a home 
You’ve been my forever mate, 
I’m so glad for never giving up on you 
You are so beautiful, 
Almost eighty-eight.
