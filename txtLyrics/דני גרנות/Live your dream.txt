Life is just a passing dream, 
Dream we wish to make so real 
Capture it in print and memory 
Photographs and film. 
History is our proof 
That forever we were here 
Day by day we count the passing time 
Year by year. 
Dream, dream, dream my love 
This is our own mind’s whim, 
There is nothing here worth living for 
But that special precious dream. 
Live, live, live my love 
Make your life the best each day 
Don’t count on the future to change your luck, 
Living now is the only way. 
Don’t count on the future for changing your luck, 
Living now, is the way. 
Be happy with the things you’ve got 
It’s not essential to compare, 
Happiness you’ll find deep in your heart 
It’s all there 
There is nothing else I wish to say, 
Every word will add more noise, 
Find the peace of mind you were searching for 
Your best choice, 
Your best choice. 
Find the peace of mind you were searching for 
Your best choice.
