Dreams don't get wet in rain. 
Fantasies leave no stain 
Tomorrow can cause no pain 
Wishes can break no chains 
Darkness won't hide the eyes 
Bombing won't shush the cries 
We've got to keep on trying 
Try again, try… try high 
Higher 
We live in a world others die in 
They starve but we do the crying 
God got the medal for trying 
But this universe is frying 
People are sold but are buying 
We've got to keep on trying 
We are an experiment 
This isn’t what you meant 
The hopes are already spent 
Dreams can not pay the rent 
We’re going to try again 
We’ve got to keep on trying
