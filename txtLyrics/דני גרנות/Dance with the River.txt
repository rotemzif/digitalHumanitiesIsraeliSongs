Her and me, he and she, you and I, look and see, 
The world is turning around. 
Go within find a place, put a smile on your face 
That which was lost now is found. 
There is no one here, not even you my dear, 
Don’t ask me why. 
That’s how it always was, devoid of any cause 
Like clouds in the sky. 
All you need is just to be 
Neither that, nor he, nor she, 
Hug a friend, and turn around with the world, 
Cook some food, stretch your legs, 
Ride a bike, play some jazz 
Don’t spend your life collecting stuff of gold. 
Look at the mountain, stare at a tree, 
Dance with the river, hum with the bee, 
Be nothing else but all that you can be,
