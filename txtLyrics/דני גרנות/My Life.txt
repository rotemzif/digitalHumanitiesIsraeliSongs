I never cared when people said what I should do with my life, 
I always did what felt just right, for my two kids and my wife. 
I’ve built a home 
Provided food 
Paid for their school 
Helped with their mood, 
I treated life as an art. 
I gave them my heart, 
There is nothing I regret until the day I depart. 
I never cared when people said to go do this or do that, 
I always heard my inner voice beyond the mind and its chat. 
I closed my eye 
Emptied the noise 
Breathed once or twice 
Dissolved without choice 
Until the silence appeared 
And my mind got so clear 
A state of bliss and love not even one drop of fear. 
I didn’t care when people laughed at my looks or my voice, 
Deep down inside I always new, that I did have a choice. 
To be strong like a rock 
Or weak as a leaf 
To say what I had to 
No matter the grief, 
Then the world was mine. 
I was on cloud nine 
And everyone around me at once looked benign. 
I live my life to the fullest now, on a mountaintop in Spain 
Cherish music food and sun, with Vivi and a Great Dane 
We read some good books 
Visit with friends 
Paint nature in oils 
Often laugh and dance 
A perfect life to be had, 
Not doing one thing we dread 
We could be in Detroit but we are in Spain instead.
