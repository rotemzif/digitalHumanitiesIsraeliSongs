No matter how you look, 
You can only see a part of everything. 
No matter how you listen, 
You can only hear some of the sounds. 
The moment you quiet your mind, and you’re out of the way, 
You’ll know in your soul what a gift it is… 
Just to be around. 
Don’t look for yourself outside, 
Be courageous - go shake hands with fear, 
Go within. 
When you’re on the other side, 
A ne day will begin. 
When you touch someone soul 
They will drink it in like water. 
When you look into their eyes 
You’ll be invited right in. 
When the smile on your face will turn a little bit softer, 
Harmony will begin.
