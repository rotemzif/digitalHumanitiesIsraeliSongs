It's about time                                 
For us to shine                                  
Line up take a bow                          
Wait for your sign                            
Pay up and walk                         
Dance your way out                        
You are best heard                       
When you don't shout                        
In this great rain                                    
I am plain                                            
It is under my skin in my bones       
My old town                                 
Won't be found                                    
It is under the heaviest stones             
I won't let go                                     
Of the thick wire                            
Break me make me                       
Head of the choir                               
In this great rain                                   
I am plain                                            
It is under my skin in my bones       
My old town                                 
Won't be found                                    
It is under the heaviest stones
