Angels surround you wherever you go. 
They followed you down here; they’ll follow you back up. 
Today you stand between the walls, one side pulls while the other one stalls, 
One day you’ll leave your skin behind. 
Stare right into your Makers eyes. 
Try not to think about these things for now. 
All of these dreams are just a distraction; they’ll only break you down. 
Today I faced the enemy’s eyes; I was so surprised; they looked just like mine. 
I could have been you in another lifetime, with another name, in another town. 
Angels surround you wherever you go. 
They followed you down here; they’ll follow you back up. 
Angels surround you wherever you go. 
They followed you down here; they’ll follow you back up.
