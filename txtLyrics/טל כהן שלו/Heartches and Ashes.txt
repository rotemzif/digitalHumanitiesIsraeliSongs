The cigarette she smoked left a funny taste 
Is it all or is there more I've missed? 
Could not remember all the words she said 
Suddenly it's hard to cry 
Got my hands on the wheel, two and ten 
Thought about the things she said back then 
Car broke down on the highway, so did I 
Like a wounded soldier returning to the war 
Lying in her bed 
Confusion has me now 
Running through my head 
Got my hands on the wheel, two and ten 
Thought about the things she said back then 
Car broke down on the highway and so did I 
The cigarette burned out 
The night is over 
It hit me in the back like a thousand lashes 
When all I'm left with 
Is heartaches and cold ashes
