How you been? It's been the longest time 
I see your hair has gotten longer 
Many waters have passesd 
Wish I could say it made me stronger 
You spark the shame within my soul 
Things of which I've no control 
Gone for two years, maybe more 
Thought my scars have all been healed 
Broken mirrors on the floor 
Make me look the way I feel 
The sweetest word cannot obscure 
The meaning and the sanity I've lost 
Don't brake my fragile state of mind 
Windows show cold winter's frost 
You free the monsters in my mind 
Things I thought I left behind 
Gone for two years...
