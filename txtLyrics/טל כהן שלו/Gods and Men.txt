Just like the ripples from a stone we grow and fade away 
Growing out of my skin 
Do a little better each day 
I had a dream but what's it to you? 
Two fragile minds that go right through you 
The way things are for gods and men 
To stand up tall and fall again 
Just like the river and the storm we slowly move away 
Stepping out of our dream 
Never for the better, no way 
I had a dream but it's behind me 
I can't let all these things define me 
That's the way the blood of men 
Can be forgotten and washed again
