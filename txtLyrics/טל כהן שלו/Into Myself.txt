Turning to see if I'm still the same 
Burning my books on an open flame 
Love weighs in gold, so I've been told 
But I'm… 
Into myself 
Down to my bones 
Scared of my own reflection in the well 
Scared of myself 
Scared of my own crazes and all of the phases 
and feeling so low 
Trying to see for myself that I'm lying 
The feeling is undefined 
Not carved in stone 
Nothing is owned but I'm… 
Into myself 
Down to my bones 
Scared of my own reflection in the well 
Scared of myself 
Scared of my own crazes and all of the phases 
I'm feeling so low 
Once had a notion 
Mad and depraved 
Cold as an ocean 
Fearful as the brave
