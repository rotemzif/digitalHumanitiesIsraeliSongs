If you can find no rhyme and reason 
And the rain is pouring out of season 
Don't have nowhere to lay your head 
And you feel you might as well be good and dead 
She will hold you to her breast 
For a while make you forget the rest of your troubles 
And your woes 
And warm you as the cold wind blows 
Oh, lady muse, you're always there 
When the world no longer seem to care at all 
She knows all about my sinful ways 
And the guilt will keep on haunting me all through my days 
No use in looking for redemption high above 
And there is no consolation in an endless love 
She will hold you to her breast 
For a while make you forget the rest of your troubles and your woes 
And warm you as the cold wind blows 
Oh, lady muse, you're always there 
When people just don't seem to care at all
