Water to my lips I beg of you 
Food and shelter and I'll sing to you 
For a long time I've not spoken 
My crown of thorns is aching 
My violin is broken 
My heart of stone is sinking 
Brother, can you spare a dime 
for a lonesome beggar out of rhymes 
it's cold out and my time's at hand 
I've lived a stranger in a strange land 
Spare me, warm my bones and tear these ragged clothes 
I've roamed this wasteland since when god only knows 
Some compassion's all I'm needing 
I'm scorned and bruised and hated 
On bended knee I'm pleading 
My tired eyes are faded 
Brother, can you spare a dime 
for a lonesome beggar out of rhymes 
it's cold out and my time's at hand 
I've lived a stranger in a strange land
