Santa Barbara wasn't big enough 
You were ready for the harder stuff 
You're the boss, apple sauce 
Queen of horses 
Found a place where I can rest at ease 
Think I'll have my breakfast at Tiffany's 
Andy is this real? 
You promised me the world 
But wasn't I just one more factory girl? 
The needle made the bad things go away 
Just wanted to be famous for a day 
Poor little rich girl puffing cigarettes 
Rolled the dice while losing all the bets 
Ciao Manhattan, socialite 
Queen of jewels 
New York City, falling down a well 
Checked into the Chelsea hotel 
Andy is this real? 
You promised me the world 
But wasn't I just one more factory girl? 
The needle made the bad things go away 
Just wanted to be famous for a day 
Factory girl, beauty so divine 
Scattered pills dream of sparkle wine 
Daddy held her close at night 
Mommy's angel 
28 and broken on the trail 
It's just another New York fairytale
