Tossed my lucky penny into a wishing well 
Didn't change a thing, oh what the hell 
Seems I keep making the same mistakes I've done before 
I was trapped under your siren spell but not no more 
I lost my tongue when I looked into your eyes 
Could not see behind all of those vicious lies 
Once you were a seashell on my own deserted shore 
Underneath my starry skies but not no more 
Whenever we're together, we never went that far 
Many times I've wished upon a falling star 
Now I see right through you, I don't know what I've bothered for 
I cried so many sleepless nights but not no more
