man was born on the wind 
'Round his neck there's a sun hung on a thread 
In his hand lies a world 
Illusions of the places I've seen in my head 
Nature will sing its song and river will flow 
As our eyes gaze to the heavens below 
Planets dance and rain clouds floating by 
The ocean stood still when no seagulls could reply 
Crows sang so sublime 
and sheep she wore wolf skin 
As a sun hung on a thread shines down 
on a man born on the wind
