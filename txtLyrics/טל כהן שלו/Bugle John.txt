Hey there Mr. ticket taker, won't you lay your gun 
I'm just a small town boy 
Much like anyone 
I ain't no troublemaker, won't you cut some slack 
Gotta get out, gotta go 
You know the only way is through these tracks 
Come on little two time baby, I did you no harm 
Loved you from a mile, I took you to my daddy's farm 
Still you left me with the bottle, left me high and dry 
If you leave me for another 
I'd rather watch you turning blue and die 
Hey now judge, your honor, sir 
I swear I didn't know 
Think somebody's drugged my whiskey back a while ago 
I can't wear this ball and chain 
I can't bend these bars 
Better let me outta here before I make somebody here see stars 
Wait a minute, Mr. Hangman 
Hold on with that noose 
Got myself a rich old daddy 
Turn the cannons loose 
See you all in hell, I swear that judgment day will come 
I will perish with the sound of screeching bugles and the roll of drums
