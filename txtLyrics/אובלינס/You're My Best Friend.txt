Ooo. you make me live 
whatever this world can give to me 
It's you, you're all I see 
Ooo, you make me live now honey 
Ooo, you make me live 
You're the best friend 
that I ever had 
I've been with you such a long time 
You're my sunshine 
And I want you to know 
That my feelings are true 
I really love you 
You're my best friend 
Ooo, you make me live 
I've been wandering round 
But I still come back to you 
In rain or shine 
You've stood by me girl 
I'm happy, happy at home 
You're my best friend. 
You're the first one 
When things turn out bad 
You know I'll never be lonely 
You're my only one 
And I love 
The things that you do 
You're my best friend 
Ooo, you make me live. 
I'm happy, happy at home 
You're my best friend 
You're my best friend 
Ooo, you make me live 
You, you're my best friend.
