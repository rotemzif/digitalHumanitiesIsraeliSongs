Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time 
I feel alive 
And the world I'll turn it inside out yeah 
I'm floating around in ecstasy 
So don't stop me now 
Don't stop me 
'cause I'm having a good time 
Having a good time 
I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky 
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity 
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva 
I'm gonna go go go there's no stopping me 
I'm burning through the sky yeah 
Two hundred degrees that's why they call me Mr. Fahrenheit 
I'm travelling at the speed of light 
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you 
Don't stop me now 
I'm having such a good time 
I'm having a ball 
Don't stop me now 
If you wanna have a good time 
Just give me a call 
Don't stop me now ('cause I'm havin' a good time) 
Don't stop me now (yes I'm havin' a good time) 
I don't wanna stop at all 
I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars 
On a collision course 
I am a satellite 
I'm out of control 
I'm a sex machine ready to reload 
Like an atom bomb about to oh oh oh oh oh explode 
I'm burning through the sky yeah 
Two hundred degrees that's why they call me Mr. Fahrenheit 
I'm travelling at the speed of light 
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you 
Don't stop me don't stop me, don't stop me hey hey hey! 
Don't stop me don't stop me ooh ooh ooh (I like it) 
Don't stop me don't stop me 
Have a good time good time 
Don't stop me don't stop me 
I'm burning through the sky yeah 
Two hundred degrees that's why they call me Mr. Fahrenheit 
I'm travelling at the speed of light 
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you 
Don't stop me now 
I'm having such a good time 
I'm having a ball 
Don't stop me now 
If you wanna have a good time 
Just give me a call 
Don't stop me now 
'cause I'm having a good time 
Don't stop me now 
Yes I'm having a good time 
I don't wanna stop at all
