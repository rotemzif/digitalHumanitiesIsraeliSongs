All these memories of me now
Like a whisper 
to a scream
A bed of nails on sharpened silver spikes 
cuts me like
a memory
A wounded smile that always makes me laugh
a photograph 
The limelight dimming on a dead end street
to the beat
And I know when the day is gone
the darkness breaks the dawn
I beg for more
A song they played so long ago
I heard it on
the radio
A dream of molten liquid breeze
wakes me from
a memory
Blue lines slashed on bloodshot
hazel eyes
itâ€™s no surprise 
It creeps back slowly coming in degrees
a memory
And night turns to another day
as it fades to grey
just like before
And I hear that sound again
I can remember when
it played before
