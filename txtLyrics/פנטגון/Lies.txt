She packed her bags to go to leave behind all the dreams of yesterday She had to get away
Through all the tears and all the lies and all the times that she tried to go before she’s walking out the door   
Nothing ever lasts forever with her back against the wall In all her plans for tomorrow there’s no place for me at all
 All the stars up in the sky shining down as she makes her getaway She didn’t want to stay
She paid the price for all the years she could not even comprehend
She finally reached the end
  Nothing ever lasts forever Looking forward, standing tall Life begins again tomorrow There’s no place for me at all
