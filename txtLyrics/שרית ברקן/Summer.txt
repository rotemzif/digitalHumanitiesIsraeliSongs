I don't like the summer 
I don't like the summer 
Makes me feel something obscene
Makes me wish all sorts of things
I wanna be precious and thin
Makes me feel something obscene
Over the rainbow and into the sea
That's where you'll find my baby and me
Every time that you come around I can't see you
Cause the light hurts my eyes
Every time that you come around I can't feel you
Cause we're sweating too much
Makes me feel something obscene
Makes me wish all sorts of things
I wanna be precious and thin
Makes me feel something obscene
Over the rainbow and into the sea
That's where you'll find my baby and me
