i didn't want them to see
that my thoughts are slowly melting
i didn't want them to see
that my sheild is slightly cracking
that i am not so sure
that my two legs are still two
and i am not so sure
that my two hearts are still one
and that they haven't split in my chest  throwing parties
when i'm in my dreams
when i'm in my dreams
they are still broken
i didn't want them to know
that my skin is dry on my little toe
i didn't want them to know
what is it i have inside
that i am not so sure
that i know where my pressure points are
and i'm not so sure
that my dreams are really dreams
when i go there i try to control them
but it's too much work
so i give up
it's broken
broken
broken
