You're cold as hell, like a
craze, mad and fazed;
you're like fire with no one to burn. Just look at your face,
you're a mess, out of place, a disaster, but waiting your turn.
You gave her quite a scare, but see you don't play fair, no you don't play fair,
wherever you are.
You're taking up all of my now's, all of my then's.
You're breaking up, you're stuck where you stand.
I'll talk her down, she'll be fine, go sit down, don't be bothered, it's under control.
See, she's alright, slightly pale.
But it's just the weight of her troubles, and kinda my fault.
You're getting out of touch and really just too much.
