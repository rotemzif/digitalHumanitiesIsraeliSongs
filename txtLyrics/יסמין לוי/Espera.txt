Wait,
The ship to oblivion hasn’t sailed
Let’s not blame what we have been through
on the shipwreck
For the sake of the old times 
For the sake of our love, I beg you 
Wait,
There are still springs within my hands
To pamper you with brand new caresses
That would die in my hands if you were to
go away
Wait for a little while, just a little bit longer
So I can deliver my happiness to you 
Wait for a little while, just a little bit longer
I would die if you go away 
Wait for a little while, just a little bit longer
So I can deliver my happiness to you 
Wait for a little while, just a little bit longer
I would die if you go away 
Wait,
I still have many joys to give to you
I have a thousand love nights I’d like to give you
I give you my life in exchange for staying here 
Wait,
I wouldn’t comprehend my tomorrow if you
were to go away
And even if you were just pretending to love me, 
I’d glady accept it
Even you didn’t love me I would adore you
all the same
Wait for a little while
