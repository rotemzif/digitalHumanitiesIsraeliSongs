LONG TIME AGO WHEN LIFE HAD JUST BEGUN
THE WORLD WAS BUILD OF STONES AND SHINING SUN 
AND GOD WHO MADE THE WORLD TRIED TO MAKE IT 
A PLACE WHERE LIFE BEGINS FULL OF LIVING PEOPLE  
AND NOT OF PAIN .  
BUT NOW GOD FINDS THE WORLD IS VERY CHANGED
THERE'S NO LOVE BETWEEN THE PEOPLE IT'S SO STRANGE
BUT THE SUN IS STILL THE SAME IT'S STILL SHINING
SO I'M FLYING FAST AWAY I FEEL THE FLOOD IS ON THE WAY
I FEEL IT COMES.
FLY … FLY … IT'S NOT TOO HIGH
IF I STAY I KNOW I'LL DIE
FLY… FLY… IT'S NOT TOO HIGH
DON'T ASK ME WHY $
IS FREE HOPE TO FIND SOMEONE WHOSE HEART
SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO SHARE MY DREAMS WITH ME
WITH HER I'M GONNA BE ON THE HIGHWAY  
THROUGH THE MOON AND THROUGH THE STARS
BOTH OF US WILL FLY TOWARDS … TOWARDS THE SUN.
Fly…fly… it's not too high…….
