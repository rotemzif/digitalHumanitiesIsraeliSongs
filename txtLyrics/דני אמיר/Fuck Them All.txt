All of these years they be stamping on my face 
What a disgrace, feel like a fox in a chase, 
Me losing the race one day 
We gonna fuck them all! 
Every generation 
There's a new regulation 
Designed to keep us down and out 
Every day, dey go out of their way 
To make us feel like we don't know what it's all about 
One day 
We gonna fuck them all! 
Sing with me brothers and sisters! 
We gonna fuck them all 
What we're gonna do? What we're gonna do? 
We gonna fuck them all 
I go a get up in the morning 
Gonna break down the segragation wall 
E gonna evacuate and burn all the banks 
And every shopping mall 
We gonna take all the generals and kindly, surgically, 
Remove them from their balls 
We gonna fuck them all 
In a gentle kind loving manner 
But nonetheless 
We gonna fuck them all 
What we're gonna do? 
We're gonna fuck them all 
חשבתי על זה כמעט כל היום 
אני עובר לאלפיון העליון 
עוד מעט יגיע לכאן עפיפון 
ייקח את כולנו לאלפיון העליון 
ושם נעשה מסיבות ונרקוד כל היום ונשיר 
את השיר של האלפיון העליון 
Fuck them all 
עלינו הם שרים, שרים וגם עושים! 
Fuck them all 
זה השיר שלהם בכלל, לא שלנו! 
Well I told my friends: 
Listen friends I am no Anarchist 
I am no antichrist 
I am a Radical Spiritual Utopist! 
We don't go round fucking people just like this 
In the middle of the East 
We do things in a different manner 
And you may not like it 
But from now on I believe what we should do is 
Hug them all! 
Fill them with love 
Show them that they are human 
We gonna hug them all! 
Love! Love! 
We gonna hug them all 
Sorry no more fucking on my shift! 
And only if they don't see the light 
And if they don't change their way 
We will have absolutely no choice 
But to go back to plan A 
And then we fuck them all 
We tried kissing we tried hugging it didn't work! 
We gonna fuck them all! 
Until they see the light 
Love will enter their hearts 
And they will awaken 
And be full of LOVE
