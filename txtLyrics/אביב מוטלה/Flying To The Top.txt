All we need is passion
All we need is love
I feel much better with you
So hold me in your arms
Let's look at the sun rise
Look in to my eyes
And don't forget tomorrow
Baby com on and break the ice
You can feel  me now
You can feel me now
Flying to the top
You can keep me now
You can keep me now
Don't leave me here alone
