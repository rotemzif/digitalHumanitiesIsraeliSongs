baby look at me 
And tell me what you see 
You aint seen the best of me yet 
Give me time, I'll make you forget the rest 
I've got more in me, and you can set it free 
I can catch the moon in my hand 
?Don't you know who I am 
Remember my name 
I'm gonna live forever 
I'm gonna learn how to fly 
I feel it coming together 
People will see me and cry 
I'm gonna make it to heaven 
Light up the sky like a flame 
I'm gonna live forever 
Baby, remember my name 
Remember, Remember, Remember, Remember 
Baby hold me tight 
Cause you can make it right. 
You can shoot me straight to the top 
Give me love and take all I've got to give 
Baby I'll be tough 
Too much is not enough 
I'll grab your heart till it breaks 
You got what it takes 
Remember my name 
I'm gonna live forever 
I'm gonna learn how to fly 
I feel it coming together 
People will see me and cry 
I'm gonna make it to heaven 
Light up the sky like a flame 
I'm gonna live forever 
Baby, remember my name 
Remember, Remember, Remember, Remember, 
Remember, Remember, Remember, Remember 
I'm gonna live forever 
I'm gonna learn how to fly 
I feel it coming together 
People will see me and cry 
I'm gonna make it to heaven 
Light up the sky like a flame 
Baby, remember my name 
Remember, Remember, Remember, Remembe
