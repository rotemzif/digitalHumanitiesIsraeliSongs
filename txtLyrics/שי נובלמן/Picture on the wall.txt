There’s a picture on the wall with a sad boy doing nothing at all 
There he stands, so all alone, doing nothing, oh 
In the winter, he'll be alive if the painter will stop wasting time 
In his naked eyes one could see all the sorrow, oh 
Standing in the wood gazing at the trees, looks so fragile 
In the winter, he’ll be alive, wake up painter! Come draw a line 
Sorry girl, I left you alone, im a sad boy, wont harm you at all 
Stay with me, its much nicer here, we will fly on the back of a sound 
On the back of a sound
