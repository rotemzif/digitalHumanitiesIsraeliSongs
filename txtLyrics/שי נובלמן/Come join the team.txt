Come join the team, and surly we can win 
The game will start any time, when we’ll decide 
We’ll beat them up, and prove that we’ve got love 
The bells were ringing in the town, just don’t back down 
I love you so, if you feel the same, be sure it will make me happy 
Please don’t go, take a chance, remember the good times we had 
Let’s find a place where we could build a home 
I asked my dad to authorize, and he said fine 
Bring your friends, and i will bring my toys 
We’ll play together; it’s all right until the night 
I love you so, if you feel the same, be sure it will make me happy 
Please don’t go, take a chance, remember the good times we had 
Come join the team, and surly we can win 
The game will start any time, just don’t back down
