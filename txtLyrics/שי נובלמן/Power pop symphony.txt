In my television I hear symphony 
Listen to the radio and die 
So I’m going to the desert, yes I'm going to the desert in July 
In my television I hear symphony 
Listen to the radio and plan 
So I’m going to the desert, yes I'm going to the desert once again 
She’s working in a company, 
Computers with a boss named Mike 
She never really liked her job 
Her life is like a photograph, 
She’s afraid that he would laugh 
Look how the wind blows, there’s a sign 
Look how the wind blows, she would try 
Look how the wind blows, she would cry 
Meet my Uncle Jack, he has been here once or twice 
Guaranteed he’ll give you a good advice, yeah 
Out tonight he’s in a desert 
Son of a gun of a desert 
A Technicolor desert with his wife
