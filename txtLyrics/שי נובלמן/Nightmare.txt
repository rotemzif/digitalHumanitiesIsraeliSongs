I see your dumb -bird is floating on a grocery lake 
Sorry, but it seems to be dead 
The flowers died tonight 
I might be wrong, he might 
And it’s one two three oh 
The time has past, and were always singing 
Yes I’m ready and I cover my eyes 
Taking a trip in the back of our minds 
Far out baby, sing lullaby 
To myself while traveling in time 
See that you're glasses where taken by a frightening man 
You feeling blind lost in a train, 
And it doesn’t really help you, help you feel all right 
Tell me the story how you've been raped 
By two gnomes on a cellophane bed 
And you ride across the sun ah 
And it’s one two three oh 
The time has past, and were always singing 
Yes we’re growing, flowers growing 
Drawing flowers, lovely drawing 
And were lying under flowers, oh god
