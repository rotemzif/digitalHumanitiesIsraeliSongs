Help, help me on the road again 
Suitcase falling from my hand 
Dirty socks, stories fed with white lies 
Help, help me on the run again 
Hear me talking to myself, 
New motel, a place for suicide, well 
I can remember day by day 
I can remember Airplane 
I can remember, my baby in the rain, she runs she runs run run 
Help, mother's on the phone again, 
Check into YMCA, 
Oh there are bed bugs in the mattress 
Help; see me fighting like a man 
While melting in the rain 
A place for suicide, well
