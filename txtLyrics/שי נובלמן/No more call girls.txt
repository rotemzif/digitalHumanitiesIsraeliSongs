Take the red shirt, it's alright 
Much too small and much too tight 
Take my sister if you want 
Ain’t she pretty? But she’s so old, she’s so old, she’s so old 
Take my wallet, I don’t mind 
Nothing you could find inside 
Be my lover if you wish 
CO’s life is short, and I'm alright I'm alright 
Just tell me where to go now 
My star will lead me, to a place where I 
I could hide; I'm losing my mind 
Note, that words could hurt me 
Like lightning over-strike 
But baby when you're near me 
I don’t mind, I don’t mind 
Read a book; there is a light 
In a dark and lonely night 
Sheriff, sheriff, here I come 
Driving Sunset Boulevard 
Book a flight to Denmark 
Football match next month 
Don’t you worry, we will lose 
Call the call girls, they'll come, they'll come
