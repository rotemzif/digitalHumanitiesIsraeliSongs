Hey good morning velvet sofa 
The room is spinning very fast 
Got to excuse me, colors in my mind 
TV’s on, there is a movie 
About a man who left his home who made a movie about a man who left his home. 
Children laughter's in my ears 
Take a walk along the street 
Greet the neighbor, Steve McQueen 
Look up to the sky 
Ohh, beautiful life, beautiful with greatest desires, are they fading out again? 
Ohh, beautiful life, beautiful with greatest desires, 
Curtains falling down, on another day. 
Than I walked into a bar, Suzie stood there not too far, 
With Cherry lips parted, there was something on her mind. 
Suzie was a bit upset because her boyfriend disappeared, 
She turned the TV on and saw the man who left his home 
Wintertime is here again 
Leaves are falling along the lane 
I look up to the sky 
Ohh, beautiful life, beautiful with greatest desires, are they fading out again? 
Ohh, beautiful life, beautiful with greatest desires, 
Curtains falling down on another day 
Dive into yesterday 
And I wonder if I’ll ever make it back into the light.
