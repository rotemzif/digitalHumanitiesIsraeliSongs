No one Knows will, will I wake up tomorrow? 
Sunset over the hill. Will I wake up tomorrow? 
Night has disappeared. Green fields are passing by. 
Let the dream come alive 
You’ll find the pretty boys in Copenhagen never smile. 
Watch out bicycle, pairs of shoes, Fisher price. 
I’m in a car I drive so fast, driving thousands of miles and miles. 
I’m in a car I drive so fast. 
Sitting by a frozen river. Haunting moon light in a hotel room. 
In a karaoke bar, drink gin and tonic, singing tunes that nobody likes at all. 
And I can’t wait and hold any longer, find me love, co's that’s all I want, 
Will I wake up tomorrow? Will the dream come alive? 
You’ll find the pretty boys in Copenhagen never smile. 
Watch out bicycle, pairs of shoes, fisher price. 
I’m in a car I drive so fast, driving thousands miles and miles. 
I’m in a car, I drive so fast. 
No more cigarettes 
You’ll find the pretty boys in Copenhagen never smile. 
Watch out their bicycle, pairs of shoes, fisher price. 
I’m in a car I drive so fast, driving thousands miles and miles. 
I’m in a car I drive so fast.
