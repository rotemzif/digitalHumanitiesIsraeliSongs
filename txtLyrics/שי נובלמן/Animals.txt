There’s a place I’d rather be 
A farm under the sea 
Love to love the animals 
Come and see them playing 
And all the children were so happy, they were playing 
Love to love the animals 
There is a cow 
There is a chicken 
There is tiger 
He’s in the kitchen 
There’s a place I’d rather be 
A farm under the sea 
Love to love the animals 
Come and see them dancing 
And all the children were so happy, they were dancing 
Love to love the animals 
There is a fox 
There is a dolphin 
There’s another dolphin 
He’s in the water 
But the bad neighbors called the police: 
“There are too many animals in my yard 
……I can't take it 
Who put the animals here? Fool? 
Take animal away “ 
‘ 
There’s a place I rather be 
A farm under the sea 
Love to love the animals 
Come and see them dead now 
And all the people in the village were so sad 
Because they loved the animals
