Swimming on a sunny day 
Girl like you so pretty 
Like the sun you're shining 
All around the world today 
In a red sport racing car 
That’s a present from an uncle 
Lives in California, a man who has no name 
You’re time is up 
And so is mine 
We’re surfing E.L.O and U.S.A 
You were saying Stevie Winwood is you’re dad 
And he might ask me to join his brand new band 
I started laughing, CO’s I thought that he was dead 
We went completely mad 
CO's this is who you are and you'll never ever change 
Thought that come into my mind 
Boy you are so pretty 
Beautiful, a Joker -Wild 
Oh tell me what's you're name 
Verse4: 
Playing football in a park 
Leaves are falling down 
Singing to themselves 
You looked at me, smiled at you 
Aha, the magic in the air 
You were saying Stevie Winwood is your dad 
He might ask me to join his brand new band 
I started laughing, I thought that he was dead 
We were sitting on my bed 
And I went completely mad 
You told me that you can’t 
CO’s this is who you are and you'll never ever change 
This is who you are and you'll never ever change 
CO's this is who you are and you'll never ever change
