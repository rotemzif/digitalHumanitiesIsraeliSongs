Babe, i've got something to say 
Something I would like you now to know. 
Bad, something wrong with the head 
Kings are building castles in the snow. 
Let's pretend that there will be a time. 
Still wonder when it will come. 
Hey, play it better once more. 
Don't forget the captain will arrive today. 
Colored rain, did it happen before? 
The railway master has just faded away. 
Dreaming dreams it's a way to get better. 
Falling stars, falling into my soul. 
Don't want to say goodnight 
I could not stop dreaming without you. 
Don't want to say goodnight 
I love you. 
In a way i am still counting clouds 
24 26 and 25 
Anyway I’m a child playing games 
Maybe tomorrow you will be the same 
Friday morning you wait for the bus ride 
328 falling into my arms 
Where all my friends when I need them so much? 
Will they still be my friends when I’m coming back home?
