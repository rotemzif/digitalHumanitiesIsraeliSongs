What is that strange air in the sky? 
Why am I standing here crying? 
Mixture of places, all those phases passing by 
Why is my window open why? 
Being a rider, I am looking for a hope and destiny 
Being a rider, I am looking for a hope and destiny 
I am a lonely boy 
I’ve been alone all my life 
And I’ll be alone until she comes, 
She will come in the morning 
We are the lonely boys 
We’ve been alone, all our lives 
And will be alone until she comes 
Things are getting strange it's hard to say 
I am dying in my bed 
Why don’t you come now? Don’t you know that it's alright? 
Why is my window open why? 
I am a lonely boy 
I’ve been alone all my life 
And I’ll be alone until she comes, 
She will come in the morning 
We are the lonely boys 
We’ve been alone, all our lives 
And will be alone until she comes
