The yellow sun is singing song 
She’s smiling, but she’s sad, she’s all alone 
Two lovely birds are flying high, above the stadium in the sky 
And can’t remember where they have to go 
He was eight years old, when someone saw him playing 
Playing football in the yard 
“Hey kid- you gonna be a legend, 
Move to Jerusalem, in Beitar you’ll be a star” 
The yellow sun is singing song 
She’s smiling, but she’s sad, she’s all alone 
Two lovely birds are flying high, above the stadium, in the sky 
And can’t remember where they have to go 
When he grew up, and became a captain, got an offer from Japan 
But Coach Danny Noiman, was not happy 
“You are not leaving Beitar, because you are my star’ 
The yellow sun is singing song 
She’s smiling, but she’s sad, she’s all alone 
Two lovely birds are flying high, above the stadium, to the sky 
And can’t remember where they have to go
