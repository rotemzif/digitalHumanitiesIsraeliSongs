Please don’t let us argue anymore 
Say, why don’t you hug me like before? 
It was sad breaking up, now we are strangers on the road 
And I feel like a clown, when I’m giving up on someone like you, I do 
And baby, you know I loved you 
Two could be better than one 
If you will see that love is around you 
And you believe in the one who believes that Love is all 
Please don’t let us argue anymore 
I’ve been broken hearted such a long time 
It was sad breaking up, now we are strangers on the road 
And I feel like a clown, when I’m giving up on someone like you, I do 
And baby, you know I loved you 
Two could be better than one 
If you will see that love is around you 
And you believe in the one who believes that Love is all 
When I dream and close my eyes its fantasy, fantasy 
Baby baby, baby I’m coming home
