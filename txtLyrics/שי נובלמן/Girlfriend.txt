I have a girlfriend (yeh, yeh, yeh) 
And it's the first time (yeh, yeh, yeh) 
I've fallen in love (yeh, yeh, yeh) 
And I'm 29 
It's all I could ask for, should have been wonderful, 
wonderful to me 
Back from New York (yeh, yeh, yeh) 
Moved into her place (yeh, yeh, yeh) 
She gave me ice-cream (yeh, yeh, yeh) 
It felt really nice 
Now I'm so fat, I feel terrible about my looks 
I have a girlfriend, I have a girlfriend, I have a girlfriend 
But I'm still lost inside 
During high school (yeh, yeh, yeh) 
I hated all the girls in my class (yeh, yeh, yeh) 
They were so nasty (yeh, yeh, yeh) 
I thought I was gay 
Things didn't change, I was miserable till the day 
she found me 
I have a girlfriend, I have a girlfriend, I have a girlfriend 
But I'm still lost inside 
"Girlfriends are not easy to find" said my mother, "Girlfriends are not easy to find" said my father, "especially the pretty ones" my grandma laughed at me 
I had a girlfriend, I had a girlfriend
