I am sitting in my room, and waiting for surprise 
While you are sitting on a tree waving goodbye 
I am sitting in my room; you are sitting on a tree 
What a disappointment- It's just you and me 
You are dabbing Vaseline on my dry dry lips 
I prefer the lipstick; co's it makes me look so chic 
You are dabbing Vaseline, I prefer the ventolin 
Tell me please oh tell me 
What "I love you, love you" means 
Why don't you come with me? Why don't you come with me, why don't you want me? 
And If you'll fail to see that I'm in ecstasy 
And there is just one thing on my mind 
Come on 
You are making noises with my best friend in my house 
I am standing jealous, drinking whisky from a glass 
My pain is getting stronger 
It's so beautiful tonight 
I don't know if you realize 
What you're doing in my house 
Why don't you come with me? Why don't you come with me? 
, why don't you want me? 
And If you'll fail to see that I'm in ecstasy 
And there is just one thing on my mind 
Come on 
At the time when I was sure that we'd broken up 
I got you're funny letter, my oh my, we're getting back 
I am sitting on a tree, you are sitting next to me 
Holding hands together and waiting for the kids
