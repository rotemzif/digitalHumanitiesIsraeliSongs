Wonderful, children smiling around the world 
Holding hand in hand, together 
Everywhere, roses dancing everywhere, secrets in the garden, the garden 
We need a place to wonder, there isn’t a place to stay 
Running around ourselves till the end 
Little child, hold you’re crying, little tears 
Rolling down your eyes, your eyes 
little child, you’ll grow up and understand, life is not so easy, believe me 
We need a place to wonder, there isn’t a place to stay 
Running around ourselves till the end
