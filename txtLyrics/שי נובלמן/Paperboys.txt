Running around with a pistol in hand 
Searching his way for tomorrow all over the town 
Its Charlie Brown, he is cracking down 
Sweating so badly, working so hard 
Here is paperboy driving, he’s driving around 
It feels so strange; so many shadows are staring at him 
And all the reflections in his mind saying “boy come on home” 
There is a place, where paperboys goin’ holiday 
There is a place, there is a place 
Hey Mr. Bungalow Bill, have you heard the news, well, she’s crazy about me 
It’s so surreal; she wants a baby from me 
Check out the paper, were going to drawn 
War is coming your way, go underground 
Don’t give up; one day you’ll find an answer 
And all the questions in his mind saying “boy come on home, come on home” 
There is a place, where paperboys go holiday 
There is a place, there is a place
