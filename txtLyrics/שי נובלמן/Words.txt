Saying the right words, all at the right time. Ohh 
I need you yeh, and you know I got a 
Nervous breakdown and I need somebody 
I’m going crazy, going crazy co’s all about you 
Saying the right words, all at the right time. Ohh 
I am hungry for the days of freedom 
In a good friend who became a stranger 
Now I’m sorry, yes I’m sorry 
Cause it’s all about you 
Go understand, it hurts, at least we’re starting over 
Be an angel, you can have some wine, be a devil you may call me sometime 
Don’t wake me up until you see a stormy weather 
Than he’s gonna go and turn his back, the prettiest guy in town is saying: 
”loving you is hard to imagine for me” 
Saying the right words, all at the right time. Ohh 
I miss you now and those days of glory, 
We had good times and we wouldn’t worry 
You were shining; I was shining in the back of my room 
Go understand, it hurts, when love aint shining over 
Be an angel, you can have some wine, be a devil you may call me sometimes 
Don’t wake me up until you see a stormy weather 
Than he’s gonna go and turn his back, the prettiest guy in town is saying: 
”loving you is hard to imagine for me”” 
If he comes across the pond, I will go and punch him, maybe 
Than he'll listen to my words, the prettiest boy in town is sick with me
