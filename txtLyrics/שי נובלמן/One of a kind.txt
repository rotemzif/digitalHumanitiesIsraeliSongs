She lived in a paper mansion 
Under clouds of love 
You’d be mesmerized, by her purple twinkling eyes 
She stood in a tulips garden 
Wearing a skin tight shirt 
And spoke about my world 
How could it be more understood 
Ivy says you are dreaming 
Well I lost all sense of time 
I am ready to go for a ride 
She is one of a kind 
Riding high with her beside me 
In our golden sky 
We saw a big balloon, 
That was covering the moon 
Time to say goodbye 
I had a tear in my right eye 
Johnny barked her name 
Till her flying saucer came 
Friends said you will get over it man 
Just give me the time 
I’m not ready to go for that ride 
She is one of a kind
