Mr. Kluger, an inventor, a smart fat man 
My brother knows him very well 
Practice at the gym club every second day 
And to the Russian girls he pays 
And the rainbow in the sky 
Is sending kisses to all the stars in space 
And she’s really getting angry 
If one of them is found dead 
Mr. Kluger went to work at the judge’s house 
I was lying on the floor 
With his magic dryer wetness all had gone 
And crazy laughter through the door 
Mr. Kluger an inventor a smart sad man 
Invented a magic salt-cellar 
Still he goes on inventing 
If he could just get it right, he might he might 
Mr. Kluger cries 
Mr. Kluger cries
