Let the stars heal your heart 
Let love come in
Let the night hold your dreams
Because life begins here
It comes around you
it flyes in sercles
Up your head down your feet
Its what bring you down
And make you cry
Its what take you up
And move your wings
Let the stars heal your heart tonight
From a far away land
Or from the corner of your street
You dont know where it goes
But you can feel what it brings
