Picture me upon your knee
With tea for two
And two for tea
just me for you
And you for me….alone
Nobody near us to see us  or hear us
No friends or relations ,
On weekend vacations
We won't have it known, dear
That we own a telephone, dear
Day will break and I'm gone awake
And start to bake a suger cake
For you to take
For all the boys to see….
We'll raise a family
A boy for you a girl for me
Can't you see, how happy we would be.
