Get back to where we were black 
Way down in the valley below
I’m in a rock on the ground 
 It’s colder than I already know
No need for sorrow 
‘Cause today i found my way 
Wake up tomorrow 
In the dawn I kneel and pray 
Won’t you come on home?
Won’t you come and break the chains
I’m haunted with memories
Won’t you come on home?
Won’t you come and wake the dead now
Free me from misery
Step right in, c’mon and get ready for it
A bag of bones on the floor 
Waiting for the sun to glow
There’s a face in the mirror 
I put together long ago
No need for sorrow 
‘Cause today I found my way 
Beg, steal or borrow
Anythin’ for you to stay
Chorus
Used to feel nothing was real / now I start to get the thrill, it’s yours
Step right in and make believe / help me find the seven seas of love
You got me craving / got me head over heels / showing what I was missing / when I was looking for the kill / No room for faking / I’ve been taking it off / now my knees all shakin’ / time to get ready for love
Get back to where / we were black / Get down / I’m there/ safe and sound
At dawn / kneel and pray /I know it’s today / now show me the way 
Chorus
