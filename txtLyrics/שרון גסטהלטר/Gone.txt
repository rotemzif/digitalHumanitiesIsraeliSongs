Sometimes I linger in the longing for you
Sometimes I wonder if it ever was true
The scent of your cheek on a stranger's face
Sends me away to a desperate place
And then I am gone
I think of the days spent waiting for you
And all of the nights in search of a clue
The truth of it all rings loud and clear
Your voice echoes in me
You're not here
And then I am gone
