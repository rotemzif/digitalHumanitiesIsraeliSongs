Mild, you're mild
I hope you know
Can't live so slow
I need to run away from here 
A thousand miles
Miles and miles
Running circles in my bed
A million thoughts are in my head
You're in my mind
Mind, my mind
It's playing games
Flashing frames 
From the time when you were mine
But, you're not mine
The demon's out 
He's out again
Chewing on my innocence
This innocence of mine
Mine, you're mine
You can go your own way
But you know you'll never get away
Because you're mild
