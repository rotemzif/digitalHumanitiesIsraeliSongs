All she said				you and me
All she said				it meant to be
All she gave me			reason to believe
When she said			she would never leave
Where are you now?
What are you doing to me?
Where are you now?
All she said				hold me tight
When we stayed			up all night
All she said				trust in me
All I have				is what she said to me…
Where are you now?
What are you doing to me?
Where are you now?
The wind you feel			I feel it too
The sky you see			is not just for you
We are on the same road	don’t turn your head away
Maybe some day…
Where are you now?
What are you doing to me?
Where are you now?
Oh she said				you and me
