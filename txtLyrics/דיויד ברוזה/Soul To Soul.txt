The leaves that cling to the bough today 
Lie on the Earth tomorrow 
Flowers of spring shall nod their heads 
And pierce my heart with sorrow 
I must leave 
You must stay 
The sun will rise and fall away 
I must leave 
You must stay 
Perhaps to come another day 
I’ll stay yours forever 
Time doesn’t mean a thing to me 
Nor love is meant for passing 
Soul to soul we’ll always be 
The love that I’ve found 
In the brown of your eyes 
Your gaze has shown me heaven 
The red of my blood 
Will show by and by 
How deeply and truly I love you
