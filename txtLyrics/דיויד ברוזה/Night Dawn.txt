The night grew cold 
The moon shown blue 
When l hit the broad highway 
The winds of change turned 
Strong and strange 
I leave my childhood behind 
Until I spy the light of day 
Dreaming of treasures to find 
If l had a silver dollar 
Spend it on the one l love 
If it's stuck in lonesome holler 
I wish it on the mourning dove 
Miles soon slid beneath my feet 
Time slipped through my fingers 
Every sweet temptation l met 
Gave me cause to linger 
Not many a wilder youth than l 
I'll ride on the dark 'til the night I die 
'Til the night l die 
Wish it on the mourning dove 
Wish it on the mourning dove
