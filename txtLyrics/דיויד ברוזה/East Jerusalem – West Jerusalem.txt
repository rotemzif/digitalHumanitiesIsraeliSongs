Same face in the Gaza
Is the same face I see out in California
Same face in Jericho
Is the same face I see down in Mexico
Same face in Tel Aviv
Is the same face I see out in New Jersey
So many places 
All share the same faces
East Jerusalem, West Jerusalem
Shalom, Salam
East Jerusalem, West Jerusalem
Shalom, Salam
Same face in the Haifa
Is the same face out in Nevada
Same face in Nablus
Is the same face out in New Orleans singing the Blues
Same face in London town
Same face out in Kingston town
So many places 
All share the same faces
East Jerusalem, West Jerusalem
Shalom, Salam
East Jerusalem, West Jerusalem
Shalom, Salam
Feet in the sand, eyes in the sky
Ears to the wall
Say, wondering if change ever come along?
Spread a little love
In the morning
Spread a little love
In the evening
Spread a little love
Before you put your head down,
Maybe when you wake up
The world will be a better place
East Jerusalem, West Jerusalem
Shalom, Salam
East Jerusalem, West Jerusalem
Shalom, Salam
