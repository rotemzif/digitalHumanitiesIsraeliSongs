Feel the wind 
As it brushes right over my cheek
See the haze
As it covers my eyes
Feel my body's intention
No mind can destroy
As it rises and leaves me numb
Feel it all coming down
Feel it all coming down
As I stand in the way
And I'm lost on the ground
I know I am safe and sound
As I catch myself dreaming
Your eyes in my mind
I know I am safe and sound
Feel my body's intentions
No mind can destroy
As it rises and leaves me numb
Feel the wind as it's blowing
I soon will be going
On my own
As I stand in the crowd
And I take in the sounds
And I feel myself going higher
Feel it all coming down
Feel it all coming down
As I stand in the way
And I'm lost on the ground
I know I am safe and sound
As I catch myself dreaming
Your eyes in my mind
I know I am safe and sound
