I tell you I'm leaving
How long can I stay
I tell you I'm shaking
How long till it goes away
I tell you I'm broken
How long can I stand on my feet
I tell you I'm trying
But how much is enough for me
I bring you roses to your plate
Surround you with angels
To guide your way
Dreaming is easy
Acting is hard
Maybe I'm dreaming
I'll act when I want
I tell you I'm leaving
How long can I stay
I tell you I'm shaking
How long till it goes away
I tell you I'm broken
How long can I stand on my feet
I tell you I'm trying
But how much is enough for me
I bring you roses…
When I’m struggling so bad
I’m lost in my head- you show
When I’m fighting myself
I hope you can reach my love
