Is it alright
If I stay today
Is it alright 
If I stay today
Take my time
Far behind leave my pride
Is it alright if I stay?
Is it alright
If we just stay today
Is it alright
'Cause I wish we could just stay
Take our time 
Far behind leave our pride
Is it alright if we stay?
Is it alright
If I decide but change my mind
Is that ok?
Is it alright if I don't want to feel obliged
in any way?
Is it alright
If I waste my time
And Lead myself to a mistake
When I roll on by
I won't ask why
I'll just accept and walk away
