Moments of anger 
I never show 
I hope you know 
Buried in silence 
Till all explodes 
I hope you know 
Fears are rising 
Climbing walls 
Broken spirits 
I hope you know, I hope you know 
A raging anger 
A sense of blame 
I hope you know 
I hope you know, I hope you know 
Fears of feelings 
Drive me away 
Fingers crossing 
And I'm on my way 
Soulful and flawless 
So beautiful 
I hope you know 
The flower you've taken 
An angel 
I hope you know 
Nights are restless 
Growling pain 
Thoughts are killing me 
I hope you know, I hope you know 
A raging anger 
A sense of blame 
I hope you know 
I hope you know, I hope you know 
Fears of feelings… 
Where is my understanding 
Where is your sense of mercy 
Fears of feelings…
