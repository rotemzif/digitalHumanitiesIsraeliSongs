Through this world will you guide me
Through this pain
Will you always hold my hand when I need you
When I don't know what I'm doing with myself
I'm a lost soul
Walking through this world
Like I have some idea
When I don't, I don't
And I take on the baggage
'Cause I think that I can
And I wait for the right time
To go with my plan
And come to you
And tell you how I feel
And when the morning comes
I will feel that I am brave again
And when you pass me bye
I will smile and then I'll walk away
I don't know what I'm doing
I don't know where I'm going
It just seems like there's something
In the way that you are
That makes me smile like a drunky
Makes me high like a drug
Makes me want to be near you
Like I'm caught in this fog
And I'll wait for tomorrow
'Cause I know that I can
And I'll wait
Cause tomorrow I will go with my plan
And come to you
And tell you how feel
And when the morning comes...
And then I'll think of it, think of it
And then I'll crave for it
And feel it all over again
