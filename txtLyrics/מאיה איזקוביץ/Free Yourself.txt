מילות השיר:
Is there a load on your back 
Pushing you down 
Tell me love 
Spread your wings 
A new day come again 
I promise it will get better 
Give it some time 
Free yourself 
Let your troubles unwind 
Sweet love of mine 
Free yourself 
Free yourself 
Is it a strain on you now 
Pulling you down 
Tell me my love 
Spread your wings 
A new day come again 
Did my promises make it better 
Healing in time 
Free yourself 
Let your troubles unwind 
Free yourself 
Free yourself
