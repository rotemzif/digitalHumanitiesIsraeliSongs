I will be the one, you’ll see I’m the only one 
Yeah I'm the only one, we belong together 
I will be the one to see you're the only one 
Yeah you’re the only one, now until forever 
You will see that we’re meant to be 
Our love will grow peacefully 
You should stay with me one more day 
So how come you still walk away 
If you are the only one 
You are the only one 
And I'm sure you feel the same 
You became the one to blame, you’re the only one 
Yeah you’re the only one who can make me so mad 
I exclaim “where is the flame?”, you’re the only one 
Yeah you’re the only one who can hurt me so bad 
We will be happy as can be 
Our love will grow tenderly 
You will say you are here to stay 
So how come you still walk away 
If you are the only one 
I am the only one 
who can make you see that, yourself 
You’re a star, let me take you far 
I can really feel who you are 
We will share everything that’s rare 
So how come you still do not care 
To know you’re the only one 
Yeah you’re the only one 
But it’s so unfair, I'm the only one 
Yeah I'm the only one to see 
It’s insane, no I remain, I'm the only one 
You are the only one who can make me so sad 
Can you see how fast I ran? 
Yeah I'm the number one, two, three 
You’re the only one who can play this game 
I'm the only one, and I'm so glad you came
