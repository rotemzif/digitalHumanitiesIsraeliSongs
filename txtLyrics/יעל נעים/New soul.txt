I'm a new soul
i came to this strange world
hoping i could learn a bit
about how to give and take
but since i came here
felt the joy and the fear
finding myself making
every possible mistake
la, la la...
i'm a young soul
in this very strange world
hoping i could learn a bit
about what is true and fake
but why all this hate
try to comunicate
finding trust and love is not
always easy to make
la, la, la...
this is a happy end
cause you don't understand
everything you have done
and why's everything so wrong
this is a happy end
come and give me your hand
and i'll take you far away
i'm a new soul
i came to this strange
hoping i could learn 
about how to give and take
but since i came here
felt the joy and the fear
finding myself making
every possible mistake
la, la, la...
