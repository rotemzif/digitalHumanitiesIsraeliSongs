Baby, can't you see 
I'm falling 
A guy like you 
should wear a warning 
It's dangerous 
I'm falling 
There's no escape 
I can't wait 
I need a hit 
Baby, give me it 
You're dangerous 
I'm loving it 
Too high 
Can't come down 
Losing my head 
Spinning 'round and 'round 
Can you feel me now? 
With the taste of your lips I'm on a ride 
You're toxic, I'm slipping under 
With a taste of your poison paradise 
I'm addicted to you 
Don't you know that you're toxic? 
And I love what you do 
Don't you know that you're toxic? 
It's getting late 
To give you up 
I took a sip 
From my devil's cup 
Slowly, it's taking over me 
Too high 
Can't come down 
It's in the air 
And it's all around 
Can you feel me now? 
With the taste of your lips I'm on a ride 
You're toxic, I'm slipping under 
With the taste of your poison paradise 
I'm addicted to you 
Don't you know that you're toxic? 
And I love what you do 
Don't you know that you're toxic? 
Intoxicate me now 
With your loving now 
I think I'm ready now 
I think I'm ready now 
Intoxica-toxicate me now 
With your loving now 
I think I'm ready now 
I think I'm ready now 
Intoxica-toxicate me now 
With your loving now 
I think I'm ready ready now 
I think I'm ready now 
Intoxica-toxicate me now 
With your loving now 
I think I'm ready now 
I think I'm ready now 
Now 
Now 
Now 
Now 
With the taste of your lips I'm on a ride
