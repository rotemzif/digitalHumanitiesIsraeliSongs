Verse 1:
Why? Did you go for this ordinary guy?
is he the one reflecting in your eyes?
is it true or just a whim, did you set your mind on him?
Verse 2:
I wonder why,
Could you not give me just one single try?
cause all your heart's desires I'd supply
now it's wrong it's just too late, I don't want you for a mate
Chorus:
I wish I'd
Rewind my life,
If I didn't get with you
I could have found some better things to do
Rewind my life,
if it wasn't for you hun, I could have maybe found someone 
Verse 3:
oh why, am I the one who always has to cry?
starring in the mirror wanna die.
shooting star oh wishing well I can't face rejection hell
Chorus:
I wish I'd
Rewind my life,
If I didn't get with you
I could have found some better things to do
Rewind my life,
if it wasn't for you hun, I could have maybe found someone 
C part:
Life is like a movie going much too fast we sometimes fall behind
be kind, rewind.
