Let’s start dreaming of a relevant cause 
when you’re going through the rabbit hole 
don’t forget to take your soul 
take a peek outside your feverish head 
when you start to hesitate 
think about your income rate 
one way ticket to oblivion 
one more easy way to breath again 
keep on doing what you do 
just keep at it then come home 
can you show me some more of who you are? 
let’s stop dreaming of a relevant place 
cause the one you’ll end up living in 
might become to a punishment 
makes me sick to see you get on that train 
with a one way ticket to oblivion 
one more easy way to breath again 
keep on doing what you do 
just keep at it then come home 
can you show me some more? 
keep on with those hollow views 
and so many broken hopes 
can you show me some more of who you are?
