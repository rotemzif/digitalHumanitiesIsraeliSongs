All of this love in my heart
Exists just in my heart
All of this beauty in my eyes 
Exists just in my eyes 
It’s not a reality 
It’s not a reality 
It’s only a reflection of me
All of the facts I know as truths
Are the worlds fattest lies
Someone whispers in my ear 
Things I have to deny 
He don’t know half of me
You don’t know half of me
I don’t know half of me
Go home, go home
All of the dramas in my life
Exists just in my mind
Acing chests in sleepless nights 
Are gone by the moment I find 
It’s not a reality 
It’s not a reality 
It’s only a reflection of me
Go home, go home
