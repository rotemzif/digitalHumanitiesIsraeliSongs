Hold back your thoughts, they must be running 
Trace the tracks of what was never-land 
Staring at you I see you trying 
To turn around 
On your way home there is not much to see 
You'll be thinking of me 
Crawl back inside and watch me fighting 
Say all you dare - beware of freezing me 
Pack up your things and leave me crying 
Or change my mind 
On your way home there is not much to see 
You'll be thinking of me 
Nothing around you will help you cry or breathe 
Close your eyes now 
Start avoiding, exposing, explaining, caressing 
Try complaining, addressing, 
some thinking or shouting 
Why can't you see I am the only one? 
Take your time. 
On your way home... 
You'll be thinking of me 
Something about you cannot make you understand me 
Are you ready to deceive
