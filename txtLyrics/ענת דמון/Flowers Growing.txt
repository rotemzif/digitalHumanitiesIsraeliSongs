Up inside the halls of my mind 
I'm inhaling all this darkness through me 
Look at me, there's nothing to see 
Do you really know who to be? 
Come near 
Let me hear it wasn't in vain You're here 
Look, that space is right behind me 
Hear those sounds, they're all around me 
Somewhere else, not faraway 
You can smell all sorts offlowers growing 
Part of me is waiting to see 
Willl really look out there for me? 
Don't go 
Don't move before I know who I am Don't leave 
Look, that space is right behind me 
Hear those sounds, they're all around me 
Smell those flowers growing in me
