Sunshine coming as moonlight leaves 
Yellow flowers are on their knees 
Tired birds and delighted trees 
Curious cats find it hard to breath 
They forgot how much fun it is 
Everybody close your eyes 
You will hear the princess sigh 
As her prince is up the stairs 
Shows his endless love to her 
Come and join us everyone 
"The Amazing Mr. John!" 
Can you see what's he's standing on? 
Now you see it, now it's gone 
Everybody clap your hands 
Raise your arms above your head 
Wave your fingers in the air 
It's the (greatest/)strangest of all fairs 
You'll touch things that are never there 
Although you've seen them everywhere 
Would you like to come with me 
You could find your own fantasy 
Magic kingdoms across the sea 
All your dreams will be running free 
You'll be screaming in ecstasy 
Windy nights and afternoons 
With the stars, the sun and moon 
In a red and bright baloon 
We will come to take you soon
