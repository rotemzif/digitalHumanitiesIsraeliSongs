Wish I could fly 
I promise not to try and touch the sky 
I’ll be so careful 
you won’t see that I am.. falling 
The earth below is waiting for everyone 
to hit the ground 
Too many people all around 
are calling. 
They’re falling. 
Above the world I keep on flying, 
watching all my dreams 
From way up there they seem so near 
Through drops of rain you’ll hear me crying 
Diving with the wind 
Afraid the sun might burn my wings
