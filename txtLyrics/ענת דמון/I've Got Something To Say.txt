I don't really know Trying not to show 
I'm just looking around 
For a place that can't be found 
I don't really mind Leaving all behind 
Don't you think it's too late 
Will you press rewind 
Put it straight, I'm not your kind ... 
Will you look me in the eye Don't you stare high above 
I've got no more tears to cry I forgot what is love 
Don't stand still, why can't you lie? 
Want it all and now Start by showing how 
I don't want to come down 
I'm a queen without a crown 
I don't really know 
Why I let you go Explanations are far 
Here we are 
Take it slow, I'm not your car ... 
Will you look me in the eye Don't you stare high above...
