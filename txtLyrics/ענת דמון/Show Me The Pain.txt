There's another place I could be 
Whisper where it can be found 
Shout the way away out of you 
And I won't hear a sound 
If you hear what I think, 
tell me who to look up to 
If you see how I feel, show me 
Try and show me another way to love you 
There's another past I could live 
Where I would have made you disappear 
I know you can't always forgive 
But try hard not to interfere 
If you hear what I think, 
tell me who to look up to 
If you see how I feel, 
show me what you're going through 
If you know what I dream, 
dori't make it all so clear 
If you feel how I feel, hold me 
Try and show me another way to love you 
Try to find me again 
Come close, and show me the pain 
Please try and find me the same 
Be nice and drive me insane
