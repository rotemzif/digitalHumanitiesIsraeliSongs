Love is always around here somewhere 
Gently it's trying to blind me 
Fun is sitting outside over there 
Watching me from not too far away 
The man inside me is dying to tell 
Important things that I would never dare 
My mind's considering heaven or hell 
I'm looking for something nice to say 
While holding you in such a special way 
Why Is it hard to see the worst in me? 
How will I run and hide away from me? 
If the pieces could fall into place 
I bet it would make you happy 
I guess my silence is leaving no trace 
But I will ignore you anyway 
While holding you in such a special way 
Why Is it hard to see the worst in me? 
How will I run and hide away from me? 
Nowâ€¦
