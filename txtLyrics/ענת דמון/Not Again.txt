If you take my hand 
I'll know you care 
If you call my name 
I will be there 
You wouldn't have to know 
I wouldn't have to tell you 
Having much to say 
I will find a way 
Sensation Perfection 
Much harm with no intention 
Secrets to explain 
Seduction Instructions 
Some black and white attractions 
Let's start and then 
Standing in the dark 
Shadows, red and blue 
I've been watching everyone 
Especially you 
I couldn't help you out 
I should have made you happy 
Well, it's not the same 
It's another game 
Sensation Perfection 
Ten films, one location 
Silence to explain 
Seduction Instructions 
No script or safe construction 
Let's try again Seduction 
There's another set of lies 
Right behind you 
Do you dare to fantasize? 
I know it isn't clear 
I think you know I'm sorry 
Having not much space 
I will find the place 
Sensation Perfection 
Safe sex with no protection 
Nothing to explain 
Seduction Instructions 
Good vibes but no production 
Let's try Arrivals 
Departures 
Explaining far, strange structures 
So hard to understand 
Some questions 
Some orders 
No heart and just two shoulders 
Is this the end? 
Something was wrong 
and we knew it all along
