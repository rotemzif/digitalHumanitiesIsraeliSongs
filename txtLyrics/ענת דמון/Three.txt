So you thought you had me 
how could you think you could get away? 
Don't you care to see me go? 
If you don't want me to leave - just say 
But I'm still not sure I'll stay 
She's around the corner - can't you smell her? 
A Cause I do, and it's too hard to bear 
It's not always good to share 
Second should come after first, you know 
Maybe you're the one to go
