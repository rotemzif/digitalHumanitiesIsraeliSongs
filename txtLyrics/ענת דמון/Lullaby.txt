Close your eyes now 
Let your mind float inside you 
Say Good Night now 
Even though it's really hard for you 
Take my hand now 
I'll touch your hair now 
Don't cry, just dream away 
Close the door I'm coming through 
Try to sleep, I'll be waiting for you 
In the darkness now 
Hold you for a while 
In your dreams you're so faraway 
In your nights I am standing here alone 
Watching you 
I'll watch your face now 
Touch your hair 
And let you dream away
