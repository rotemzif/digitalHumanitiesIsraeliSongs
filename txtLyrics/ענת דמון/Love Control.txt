Surrounded by the cloud you live in 
I can't control this love you're feeling 
You're looking at me 
So why don't you see 
That I'm gonna break your broken heart 
Don't let me do this to you 
Don't help me ruin you 
No, I won't wrap my arms around you 
No 
You're gonna hate me so 
You're gonna come and go 
You're gonna come - and go 
I won't let you see how good it could be with me 
Don't let me do this to you...
