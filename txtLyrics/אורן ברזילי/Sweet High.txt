…I never knew
I could smile just like you
Then hand me lovely lies, ten thousand joys will rise
it's God's worst love
Be, my pretty blue
Cover me with all of you
Put on your pretty face, fix me I'm a mess
Save me
And it's driving me insane this old urge to see your face
Aching through my loving blood again
You are so beautiful addictive beautiful
My sweet high
I…I never knew
I'll die each night for your divine shine to be bright
Light up my face again
Ring them old bells again
Make it right
We ..we know you well that sweet smile can turn to hell
And now your dance is done
You had your little fun
But no one leaves
