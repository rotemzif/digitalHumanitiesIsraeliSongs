We all knew why you came here for pride keeps you blind
And lady luck has blown her wind to the other side
Sometimes they keep you tall but when you’re bound
to fall no one will hold you strong
Ten little drummer boys present you royal noise but now they are all gone
You thought you’ll top it all you thought you’ll play the roll
walk the dead back to life
But look at you my dear all stroke with pain and fear
and no one here really minds.
We all knew why you came here for pride keeps you blind
And lady luck has blown her wind to other side
Let all your runners go and let your people know this time it might be real
And now you’ll have to grace your failure face to face you’ll hate the way it feels
Why did you do that for when God let you in the door you don’t get all lost inside
What more can I say I hope you’ll find your way the saddest man alive
We all knew why you came here for pride keeps you blind
And lady luck has blown her wind to other side
