13 years of Depression
13 years for this burning ground
13 years to my dying nation
Let my people go
13 years where we breathing fire
13 years full of brothers hate
13 years that are going nowhere
Nowhere my heart sets
Forgive us for the madness we don’t know what to
For every road we’ve taken
We could not find a passage through
All eyes on us but they don’t seem to realize
You cannot fight to conquer when your you’re fighting for your life
And for the love of my people for the love of my land
I hope their hunger can handle all they have been fed
So let us hear the silence let us turn the page
Unpleasant melodies of a generation’s rage
