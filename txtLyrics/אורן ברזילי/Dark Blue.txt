feel so dark blue 
feel so heavy to me 
go tell them all you are not the one 
seasons have changed, all your heroes have died 
its hard to go on when you got no cause 
the lie and the truth 
the lie and the truth 
i cant tell which is who 
you can not see a thing 
its really hard to see when its all dark blue 
it always seem that good things will never come your way 
then a pies of heaven bless you for a sunny day 
so for the first time in your life you feel 
one hundred smiles strong
