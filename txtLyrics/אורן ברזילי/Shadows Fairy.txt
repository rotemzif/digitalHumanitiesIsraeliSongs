Born to the shadows fairy
She pours love hard and scary
It leaks from blue sky, burns your ground
Eternal life well…who needs that
I don’t want to be God’s little pet
Heaven is nothing to die for
She was in love with sorrow
After endless smiles she borrowed
She gave it back to the young and strong
Goodbye to lady darkness you raised with the heartless
And I obtained a heart of stone
Born to the shadows fairy
No thank yous are necessary
She always claims a favor back
She’ll take your name she’ll write you down
It would take a while but she’ll come around
with tender dark she’ll greet you’re day
She was in love with sorrow
After endless smiles she borrowed
She gave it back to the young and strong
Goodbye to lady darkness you’re raised with the heartless and I obtained
a heart of stone
