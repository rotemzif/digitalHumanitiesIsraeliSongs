Soul soldiers in a row please tell me where do they go
Soul soldiers in row please tell me where are they from
An angry mother and an angel met down by the ocean after the sunset
“it’s been a while and I want to get all the reasons for my son’s death”
it took a while then the angel replies
“I cannot name any reasons or why sometimes they want you up in the sky
for you were born as pure as you died”
Soul soldiers in a row please tell me where do they go
soul soldiers in row please where are they from
“ well did you see him” then the mother asked
“his last breath” so the angel said
“two roads he was facing up ahead the one was bright and the other’s red
he could not tell which one has held eternal sacrifice which one was fate
stop your searching then the deep voice said give up your own
and many lives you’ll save”
Soul soldiers in a row please tell me where do they go
soul soldiers in row please where are they from
“You cannot fill the empty space in me you cannot take away
my memories the mother cried in agony
but there’s one thing you can do for me I wish to see my son
one last time and I’ll give up this life of mine”
and for a second the mother could swear she saw her son smiling through the blur and
she was gone with the soul soldiers
