Look at them new money boys
See them making all that noise
Hear how new money sounds
Spreading diseases in town oh what a hateful sound
And one day you’ll hate to see it was not meant to be
You lost it all at once
You’ll find yourself lying on the sidewalk of the road all flat and broke
How black hearts turn to gold
An endless hunger to hold
The sweetest of money taste never to be replaced
The world is all for sale
And love is turning pale
You held it all at once
You’ll find yourself lying on the sidewalk of the road all flat and broke
Go and plant your seed of wealth feed it until it’s out of breath
Searching for the rich man’s bound
One in a million found
