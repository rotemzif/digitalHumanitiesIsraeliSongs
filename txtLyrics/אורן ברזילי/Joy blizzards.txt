They’re looking straight at me
And I’m looking back to see
It might be a mistake
We’re here for your own sake
Was I a little wild, a fantasy driven mind?
It’s blinding I can’t see it can’t be good for me
And I’ve been looking at the wrong faces for the wrong reasons
for so God damn long
And I’ve been running out of breath mister the joy blizzards
will leave me with no home
The mighty clowns have caused my biggest highs and lows
And now I had enough no one is built that tough
The bottom will hit me hard
And I hope I won’t be found no one will hear me call
Clean my blood, break my fall
And I’ve been looking at the wrong faces for the wrong reasons
for so God damn long
And I’ve been running out of breath mister the joy blizzards
will leave me with no home
And I’ve been hanging at the wrong places with wrong faces
for so God damn long
And I’ve been running out time mister the joy blizzards left me with no home
And I’ve been thinking about my mama lately and how she said sadly:
You know there’s nothing wrong with being blessed my dear old baby but acting
crazy will leave you with no home
