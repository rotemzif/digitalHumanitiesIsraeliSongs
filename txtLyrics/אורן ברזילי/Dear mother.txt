I got one broken heart and
I got two eyes to watch it bleed
I got three guitars and
I got four strings to make it ring
I got five reasons why…
I shouldn’t leave my bed today
I got six ways to choose from, which one will be my way
Dear mother please help me
Because I got no room to spare in this hateful heart
And it’s getting dark and dark
I got one empty pocket
I got two hands to dig in deep
I got three dirty thoughts and I am aiming for your loving whip
I got four happy tunes they going to put you right to sleep
You got five minutes left to sit around and hear me weep
