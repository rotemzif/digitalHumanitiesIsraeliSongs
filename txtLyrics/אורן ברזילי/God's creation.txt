It’s all in all God’s creation
We put the lost ones in the rear
You cannot fight what you can’t see
You can like what you fear
It’s takes a while to plan a failure
Sometimes you don’t see the details clear
And so you stick your head in a rabbit’s hole
You scream they do not hear
It’s all in all God’s creation
We put the lost ones in the rear
You cannot fight what you can’t see
You can like what you fear
Because you’ve been friends with sorrow demons
They like to turn your world around
And all the noises in the corner sound like
The way that silence sounds
It’s all in all God’s creation
We put the lost ones in the rear
You cannot fight what you can’t see
You can like what you fear
And fuck the kindness I’m a bitter man
And fuck the sober life I try to live
And fuck that bullshit that all you get is all that you give
