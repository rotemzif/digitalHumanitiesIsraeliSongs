You are my light, 
you are my brain, 
you are my sorrow. 
You are my fight, 
you are my pain, 
you're my tomorrow. 
You are my spark, 
you are my dreams, 
outside my window, 
and when it's dark, 
you hide the fears, 
under my pillow. 
You and me 
we fly to the heart of the sea, 
you and me. 
Everywhere you go, 
it's like the first time, 
every tear that falls, 
it's like the first child we hold. 
You and me 
we fly to the heart of the sea. 
You and me 
we fly where the mountains are free. 
You are my light, 
you are my pain, 
you're my tomorrow
