If I should stay 
I would only be in your way 
So I'll go but I know 
I'll think of you every step of the way 
And I will always love you 
I will always love you  
I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of 
And I wish to you joy and happiness 
But above all this I wish you love 
I will always love you 
I  I will always love you 
Darling I love you 
I'll always, I'll always love you   
I'll always love you   
I'll always love you
