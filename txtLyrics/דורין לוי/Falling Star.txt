Every time I look at you 
I see a falling star 
I just need to make a wish 
You fall into my arms 
Nobody knows you as well as I do 
Nobody goes through the things that we do 
Nobody sees you the way that I do 
The way that I do 
The way that I do 
They don't touch you 
They would love to if they knew 
They don't try to 
Only I do to 
Save your breath I'll come to you 
No matter where you are 
I don't need no inspiration 
I feel how close we are 
Nobody knows you as well as I do... 
They don't touch you 
They would love to if they knew 
They don't try to 
Only I do to 
They don't touch you 
They would love to if they knew 
They don't try to 
Only I do to
