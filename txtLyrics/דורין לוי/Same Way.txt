The same way, The same way you talked to me 
The same way you're probably 
The same way free of me 
The same way, The same way you smiled at me 
The same way you're perfectly 
The same way over me 
I want you (X3) 
It's a shame, a shame that I began 
To see the world 
I'm loosing in the end 
Only in the end 
I see The world I'm loosing 
The same way, same way that you're happy 
The same way it was meant to be 
The same way it's time for me 
I lost you(X3) 
It's a shame, a shame that I began 
To see the world 
I'm loosing in the end 
Only the end 
I see The world I'm loosing 
It's a shame that I bega 
To see the world 
I'm loosing in the end 
Only the end I see 
The world I'm loosing 
I'm loosing... 
There's no way that I could see 
There's no way differently 
What you mean to me
