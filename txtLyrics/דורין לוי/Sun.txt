This guy 
Knows what he's talking about 
He blows away my devil's doubt 
I'm in too deep 
I walk asleep 
He guides me north 
When I'm going south 
This guy 
Taught me what I am about 
Broke the walls and left me to watch 
This movie scene I'm starring in 
Won't begin I see the end 
Though I know I'll get hurt 
I wish he'd stay 
Though I know I'll be better 
Without him I can't release 
You make sense 
It's obvious 
It's underneath my bones 
I find myself 
Where no one else 
Is reaching for the sun 
At night 
He knows what I'm talking about 
When I'm lost in a beautiful gown 
Like a child I want him know 
These lonely nights he's not around 
Though I know I'll get hurt 
I wish he'd stay 
Though I know I'll be better 
Without him I can't release 
You make sense 
It's obvious 
It's underneath my bones 
I find myself Where no one else 
Is reaching for the sun 
You make sense It's obvious 
It's underneath my bones 
I find myself Where no one else 
Is reaching for the sun 
I'm reaching for the sun
