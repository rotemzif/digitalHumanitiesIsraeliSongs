Time seems to run so fast 
You'll never know 
How come it never last's 
You'll never know Why 
I lied just to be with you 
You'll never know How many nights 
I spent waiting for you 
Praying you'll come to me 
Come baby fly with me 
Over bridges and over sees 
Where we can live our dreams 
You and me 
I donâ€™t know how it ends 
I'll never know If god has a different plan 
Then why I remember you 
You'll never know How many nights I cried 
waiting for you 
Praying you'll come to me 
Come baby fly with me...
