Good night child 
I'm here by your side 
close your eyes 
to a soft lullaby 
good night child 
good night child 
I will turn off the light 
don't be afraid of the dark 
I will let in the moon light 
to bring the darkness apart 
good night child 
good night child 
no need to cry child 
don't be afraid 
no demos or monsters 
crawling under your bed 
sleeping tight 
good night child 
imagine the things 
that you really want 
let soft sweet dreams take you 
and all the demons be gone 
good night child 
good night child 
no need to cry child 
don't be afraid 
no demos or monsters 
crawling under your bed 
sleeping tight 
good night child
