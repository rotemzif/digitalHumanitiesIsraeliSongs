Their trying to tell you 
There's no reason to fall apart 
The smooth way you took to me 
Almost broke my heart 
All the pieces of my soul 
All the dreams I used to know 
Right now you turn me on 
And I want you through my hole 
There's no need to apologies 
I was with you when you were there 
The touch you give to me 
Makes me feel unfair 
All the pieces of my soul...
