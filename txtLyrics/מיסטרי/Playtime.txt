It's like a dying wish 
Every day is a race 
A race to the unknown 
Something inside is burning 
Burning the illusions 
You're feeling inside me 
You're running to hide from pain 
Na,na,na,na,na,na,na 
You've wasted those few years 
Hiding between fears, the end 
Na,na,na,na,na,na,na 
You're losing your mind 
Trying to find the way 
Na,na,na,na,na,na,na 
Going threw pictures 
Photos-it's all the same 
Na,na,na,na,na,na,na 
Pressure, pressure in my head 
I cannot understand it... 
You ask for my help 
Your feeling you can't hold on 
Na,na,na,na,na,na,na 
I give you my power 
And burning desire of truth 
Na,na,na,na,na,na,na
