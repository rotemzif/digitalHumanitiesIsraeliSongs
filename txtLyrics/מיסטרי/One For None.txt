It's like a dream, it's like a fairytale 
Emotions clear as the sky 
No more feelings that you burn away 
Only dreams-as you fly 
Flowers calling you and telling you their tale 
Look around you-it's you life 
All those rainbows that you said you never had 
The universe-it's your prize 
Memories of times that you said you were okay 
And all did -it's just cry 
Now you see yourself without running away 
No more hiding no more lies 
It's like a dream, it's like a fairytale...
