Isn't that cruelty, to kick my life back to me? 
Growing further every day, win me over if you may 
Disturbing feelings, I don't care, all the dreams are everywhere 
Always think I'm going down, destruction often comes to town 
Would you like to be free? 
Fantasy and dreams is all that you see 
Every day you fight a battle for the life you cannot handle 
The soldiers aren't on your side, just because you're not alike 
Feeling like giving up, love is not an easy job 
If every day is a war, why you're knocking on my door 
Would you like... 
Feeling lonely-cannot hide the world isn't on my side 
Want to feel every step, when everybody's in a race 
Animals are not so cruel, it's too bad that humans rule 
If they knew they'll be ashamed, that us and them are just the same 
Would you like...
