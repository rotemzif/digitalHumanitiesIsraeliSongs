Growing old in the dark 
it's such a waste of life 
You were born and now you're gone 
I still can see the light 
You used to tell me how you want 
to be great sometime 
You were a friend and now you are 
an angel in the sky 
Burning souls all around 
looking for the best of times 
Is this forever or you might 
come home sometime? 
You fought a battle with your heart 
for love you will not find 
I miss you brother all the time 
you can hear me in the night 
You used to teach me not to be 
a person in disguise 
Heaven is the place for you 
I hope we'll meet sometime 
Growing old in the dark 
-it's such a waste of life 
You were a friend and now you're gone 
We still can feel your light 
You used to tell me how you want 
to be great sometime 
You were a friend and now you are 
an angel in the sky
