Could this be the time for love? 
Could this be the time for hate? 
Could this be the time for heaven? 
Could I be the one that live forever? 
Walking in this path of angels come to rest 
Telling you those lies of heavens piece of mind 
Did you find what you were looking for? 
Did you find the place you wanna go? 
Did you know there's life after death? 
Did you walk along without a trace? 
There is the time to bring in emotions 
There is the time to bring in destruction 
Do you believe your breathing in passion? 
Do you believe in eternal fame? 
Living forever- exactly the same 
Everybody will remember your name 
Could this be the time to fall apart? 
Could this be the time to burn my heart? 
Could this be the time to say goodbye? 
Could I be the one to see me die? 
Walking down the road and devils alley shows 
Creatures come around and banshees making sound 
Did you find...
