I see shadows walking across the room 
I hear them laughing without a tune 
I smell a weak unsupported child 
They crashed his dream of not being bound 
And I don't know which way I should go 
All I know is that I am fading slowly 
And I know that you won't believe me 
Cause I see things that you cannot see
