Looking for the answers to give me directions 
Feeling in the blanks with copy's of obsession 
Wondering where are those pills that you gave me 
If ever you will find the place that you forgave me 
Searching for the melody's under the table 
Thinking of things to give me a flavor 
Wondering if we'll be together 
I feel as if you could be my savior 
Years go by and I still can't be myself 
Sowing in the garments of my perfect self esteem 
Thinking of new powers I can surrender to 
Maybe someday I'll still believe in you 
Searching for the melody's... 
Burning with your flesh so you can erase me 
Breathing in the lines of poems with serenity 
Inspired by the words of historic memories 
Obsession for desire-that's all that you left me
