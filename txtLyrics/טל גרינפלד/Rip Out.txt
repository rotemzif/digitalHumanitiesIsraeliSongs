Rip out your heart from your chest
got no use for it, you'd do well with the rest
it slows you down, it makes you timid and frail
no telling when the stupid organ will fail
keep up the flow of
going places and
making faces and
small talking with a ready made smile
you've got a pretty good chance of not having to
deal with any feelings more intense 
than the occasional drunkenness
so stupid it hurts
Rip out your heart from your chest
you're so strong, you're really one of the best
you seem to suffer no distractions at all
all future tasks are fully under control
keep up the diet of
charming people and
trying to sweep all that
come before you with your ravishing style
you get your fair share of sex and adventures 
and v's in all the checkboxes 
you get in all those stupid journals
so stupid it works
Rip out your heart from your chest
buy a box of chocolates and pretend it's a nest
cook up a jelly of emotions to stir
no cause for shyness when you're never quite here
smear colors over
any trace of 
anything of
real importance you 
need to face
for it's so much safer for you
to rip out your heart
