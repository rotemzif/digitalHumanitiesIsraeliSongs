Every time in my life when I think that it's gone 
You come and nudge me along 
Every time in my life when I think there's no way 
You come and make me feel safe 
Every time in my life when I think there's no hope 
You come and take off the rope 
And all I know, is I'm alone 
Forever I am told 
You stayed so long I owe you more 
Every time in my life when I think I need home 
You come and make it enough 
Every time in my life when I sing out of tune 
You come and tell me "just start again darling" 
Every time in my life when it wouldn't stop raining 
You came and asked me to take.. 
..your hand and dance, such true romance 
I thank you for the chance 
And every time it feels so right to be inside 
I want to be inside 
How I wait to be inside of you 
Every time in my life when I think that I'm gone 
You come and show me I'm wrong 
Every time in my life when I think there's no hope 
You always take off the rope 
The figurines that come to mind 
Connect me with these crimes 
'Cause in my sleep, I smell you still 
Like I might be just fine 
And all I know is I can't wait to be inside 
How I want to be inside 
How I wait to get inside of you
