Oh my Lord, it's time to pray
When a new sun shines, make hay
save my land from desert stay
Call the oceans, salt to melt away
Aghotir kapuyt erkinq,
Aghotir dashti caghik,
Vor el cav chlini,
Vor anhog jpta mankik
(Pray , blue sky,
Pray, flower of the field,
So there will be no pain, 
So the child will smile again)
uri boey el beiteno
kinsharim porsim yadeynu
mele'eem bezaamir wovekol hator
(wake up, come to our homes
As eagles spreads their wings, 
We spread our hands on you
Let the doves and the nightingale sing for us-
peace is coming !
Oh my Lord, it's time to pray
When a new sun shines, make hay
save my land from desert stay
Call the oceans, salt to melt away
CISTO SRCE BOGA MOLI, DA JE MIR I DA NAS 
VODI POGLEDAJ, SPASI NAS, SVE  BOLI OTERAJ.
(PURE hearts PRAY TO our LORD-
To LEAD US TO PEACE.
LOOK AT US, SAVE US, 
take the pain away.
ZA NAS SRCE BOGA MOLI DA JE 
MIR I DA NAS VODI
FOR  ALL OF US , ALL PURE HEARTS 
PRAY TO our LORD to LEAD US TO PEACE
