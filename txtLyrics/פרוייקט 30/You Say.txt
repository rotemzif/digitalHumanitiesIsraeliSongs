You Say
I bear my desire it's slow in the street
while you speak of your trouble with woman
It effects how you feel
you say
you say
I will never have you
comprehend
the silence
It effects how you feel
you say
you say
I'm the observer, over in the corner
longing for every boyish grin
you throw my way
It effects how you feel
you say
you say
We share a laugh
it is quiet enough
you say you feel invaded
It effects how you feel
you say
you say
You place one burning hand
in between my thighs
press
hard
