I just don't know what to do,
Should I give in to my emotions?
But then again it can't be true
'Coz you're acting like there's no one else but you.
Don't you toy me,
You've got the power to destroy me.
Wish I knew if what you said is true.
I'm here dreaming that together we'll be
Firing it up in the middle of the night,
Firing it up when the sun shines bright,
Firing it up, my knight has got to fight for it,
Fire me up and it will be all right.
My love will be there for you,
If you feel so too,
I wanna whisper your name.
After all that we have been through,
All I want is you,
Please don't play with me any games.
Don't you toy me...
Firing it up...
