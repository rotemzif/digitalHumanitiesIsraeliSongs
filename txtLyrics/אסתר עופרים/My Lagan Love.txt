Where Lagan stream sings lullaby, there blows a lily fair
The twilight gleam is in her eyes, the night is on her hair
And like a lovesick lenanshee she hath my heart in thrall
Nor life I own, nor liberty for love is lord of all
And often when the beetle's horn hath lulled the eve to sleep
I steal unto her shieling lorn and thro' the dooring peep
There on the cricket's singing stone, she stears the bird in fire
And hums in sad, sweet undertone the song of her desire
Her welcome like her love for me is from the heart within
Her warm kiss is felicity, that knows no taint or sin
When she was only fairly small her gentle mother died
But true love keep s her memory warm, by Lagan's silver side
