Cold winds may blow o’er the icy sea
But I'll take with me
The warmth of thee
A taste of honey,
A taste much sweeter than wine
I will return...I will return
I'll come back
For the honey and you
I leave behind
My heart to wear
And may it e’er remind you of
A taste of honey
A taste much sweeter than wine
I will return...I will return
I'll come back
For the honey and you.
