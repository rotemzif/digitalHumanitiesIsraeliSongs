I have dreamed
That your arms are lovely...
I have dreamed
What a joy you'll be...
I have dreamed
Every word you whisper
When you're close
Close to me
How you look
In the glow of evening
I have dreamed
And enjoyed the view
In these dreams I've loved you so
That by now I think I know
What it's like to be loved by you
I will love being loved by you!
