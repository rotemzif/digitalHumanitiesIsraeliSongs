Show us the way to the next whiskey bar
Oh, don't ask why
Oh, don't ask why
For we must find the next whiskey bar
Or if we don't find the next whiskey bar
I tell you we must die
I tell you we must die
I tell you
I tell you
I tell you we must die!
Oh Moon of Alabama
We now must say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
And must have a whiskey, oh, you know why.
Oh Moon of Alabama
We now must say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
And must have whiskey, oh, you know why.
Show us the way to the next pretty boy
Don't ask why
For we must find the next pretty boy
Or if we don't find the next pretty boy
I tell you we must die
I tell you we must die
I tell you
I tell you
I tell you we must die.
Oh Moon of Alabama
We now must say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
And must have a boy oh you know why.
Oh Moon of Alabama
We now must say goodbye

And must have a boy oh you know why.
Oh show us the way to the next little dollar
Oh don't ask why
For we must find the next little dollar
Or if we don't find the next little dollar
I tell you we must die
