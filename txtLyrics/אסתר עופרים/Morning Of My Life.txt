In the morning, when the moon is at its rest
You will see me, at the time I love the best
Watching rainbows play on sunlights
Pools of water iced from cold nights
In the morning, 
'Tis the morning of my life 
In the daytime, I will meet you as before
You will find me, waiting by the ocean floor
Building castles in the shifting sands
In a world that no one understands
In the morning
'Tis the morning of my life
'Tis the morning of my life 
In the morning of my life
The minutes take so long to drift away
Please be patient with your life
It's only morning and you're still to live your day 
In the evening, I will fly you to the moon
To the top righthand corner
Of the ceiling in my room
Where we'll stay, until the sun shines
Another day, to swing on clotheslines
May I be yawning
'Tis the morning of my life
'Tis the morning of my life 
In the morning
In the morning
In the morning
