There's a far land I'm told
Where I'll find a field of gold,
But here I'll stay with you.
And they say there's an isle deep with clover
Where your heart wears a smile all day through.
But I know well they're wrong
And I know where I belong
And here I'll stay with you.
For that land is a sandy illusion,
It's the theme of a dream gone astray.
And the world others woo
I can find loving you,
And so here I'll stay!
