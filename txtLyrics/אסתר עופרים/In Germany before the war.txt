In Germany before the war
There was a man who owned a store
In nineteen hundred thirty four
In Dusseldorf.
And every day at five o nine
He'd cross the park down to the Rhine,
He'd sit there by the shore.
I'm looking at the river
But I'm thinking of the sea
I'm looking at the river
But I'm thinking of the sea
A little girl has lost her way
With hair of gold and eyes of gray
Reflected in his glasses
As he watches her.
A little girl has lost her way
With hair of gold and eyes of gray.
I'm looking at the river
But I'm thinking of the sea
Thinking of the sea
Thinking of the sea
We lie beneath the autumn sky
My little golden hair and I
And she lies very still
