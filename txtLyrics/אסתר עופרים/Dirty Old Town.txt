I found my love by the gasworks croft
Dreamed a dream by the old canal
Kissed my boy by the factory wall
Dirty old town, dirty old town
Clouds are drifting across the moon
Cats are prowling on their beat
Springs a girl in the streets at night
Dirty old town, dirty old town
Heard a sirens from the dock
a train sets the night on fire
Smell the spring in the smoky wind
Dirty old town, dirty old town
I'm going to take me a good sharp ax
Shining steel tempered in the fire
cut you down like an old dead tree
Dirty old town, dirty old town
