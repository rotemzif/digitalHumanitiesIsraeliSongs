Smile I’m gonna get you soon 
I'm gonna get you fast 
gonna be so cruel 
Gonna cross the line I'm 
gonna make you mine 
Take you out of time 
Smile I'm gonna run to you 
Gonna be stay around 
Gonna make you proud 
Gonna cross the line 
Gonna make you mine 
Take you out of time 
Tonight, you might say 
and probably for the rest 
of the day 
Tonight, you might say 
And probably for the rest of the 
day 
Smile I’m gonna get you soon 
I'm gonna get you fast 
gonna be so cruel 
Gonna cross the line 
gonna make you mine 
Take you out of time 
Tonight, you might say 
And probably for the rest 
of the day 
Tonight, you might say 
And probably for the rest 
of the day 
Get it over the shoulder 
Sometimes it seems to be real 
and you are wrong 
Over & over sometimes it 
seems to be true 
You know it’s just a 
point of view 
Tonight, you might say 
And probably for the rest 
of the day 
Tonight, you might say 
And probably for the rest 
of the day 
Smile I’m gonna get you soon
