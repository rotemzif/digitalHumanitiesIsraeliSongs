Why don't you take a minute
Before you go and break
All that we built
All that we have
Why don't you take a minute
Before you start to pack
all your things and leave me bleed on the floor
and i know that it's raining outside
but its colder in here
how do you feel
why don't you say
'Couse i cant breath without your love
and i can't sleep without your hug
and i just fear
i won't heal
without your love
why don't you take a minute
before you say all those words
that are breaking my heart
and piercing my soul
and know i was wrong every time that i looked at another
baby don't bother
say it again
even though I was sometimes a mess
I loved you with all of my heart
I'm only human I'm making mistakes
and I'm regretting it right now
you say too little
you say too late
but i think it's your weakness that says it
and please don't forget
who was beside you
when you didn't have anyone else
Cause I cant breath
no I can't sleep
no I can't breath
