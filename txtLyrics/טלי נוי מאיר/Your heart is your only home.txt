You wake up with an odd feeling
Its your truth calling you
But you shut it down
'cause they told you there's only one way to go
and you think:
I'm trying to survive here, I'm trying to be loved
what has the truth got to do with anything?
Trying to prove what you are not
doesn't show who you really are
it's like pointing a flash light at a star
you know it doesn't make it shine
Oh – Just let go
forget what they are saying
trust what you have always known
your heart is your only home
You walk between the words people throw at you
It's their fears that shape your walk, your face, 
your song...
and all that avoiding sucks the life right out of you
and you drop dead on the couch 
drowning yourself in blue pictures
Trying to prove what you are not
doesn't show who you really are
it's like pointing a flash light at a star
you know it doesn't make it shine
Oh – Just let go
forget what they are saying
trust what you have always known
your heart is your only home
If we're fighting to survive
why do we hardly feel alive?
If we're waiting to be loved,
why do we still feel left out?
Oh – Just let go
forget what they are saying
trust what you have always known
your heart is your only home
if you listen to your heart 
you will shine like a star
in the darkest night in the darkest times
'cause your heart is your only home
