I Remember the first day 
I remember your smiling face 
i was melt by the light of your love 
the night we walked together and stars above 
BABY I WANT YOU and i want you to know i love you 
Baby i need you and i want you to show me your love 
If you want me 
if you need me 
Its so easy to love you 
there is only one way 
Just one look at you and i knew this is love 
and i know its true 
BABY I WANT YOU and i want you to know i love you 
Baby i need you and i want you to show me your love, ohhh
