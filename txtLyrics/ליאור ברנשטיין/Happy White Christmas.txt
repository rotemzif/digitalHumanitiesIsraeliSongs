I can hear the bells ringing far from the hill
When the snowflakes starts fallin i can hear the voice calling me
deep inside my heart theres a little prayer i know
Its just one of million, yeah i know for sure
and i can feel it, i can feel it, i can feel it in my heart it will come true
Yes Its gonna be a Happy White Christmas
Cause my baby's coming home to me
Yes its gonna be a Happy White Christmas
Cause i know that youll be home with me
I can feel the magic its almost Christmas day
Well be sitting by the fire place while the snowflakes fallin down, i love you babe, were together now
We dont need anyone else just you and me
Its gonna be a Happy White Christmas
Cause my baby's coming home to me
Yes its gonna be a Happy White Christmas
Cause i know that youll be home with me
