Chillin with a bunch of friends
Looking for some good time
Smoking, drinking red wine
I don't want this night to end
Cause we be makin out when
We think no one's watching
I wore that little dress for you
Your hand between my thighs 
Baby let me get high
Whisper in my ear tonight
Through your heavy breathing
"You feel so amazing"
Why Does It Always Have To End With I Love You?
Tell me
That you like me
That you need me
That you've never wanted me more
Baby feel my body
I'm not just somebody
To spend the night with when you're bored
Waiting on my favorite part
Texting me at midnight
"Baby can I swing by?"
Sweet surrender in your arms
Never let me go
Don't ever let me go, no
Lost myself in you again
Baby please don't hate me
You can never make me
Fall out of love with you
So take it like a man
And we can stop pretending
Why Does It Always Have To End With I Love You?
Tell me
That you like me
That you need me
That you've never wanted me more
Baby feel my body
I'm not just somebody
To spend the night with when you're bored
Why does it always
Why does it always
Have to end
Why does it always
Why does it always 
Does it always have to end with this
Why does it always
Why does it always
Have to end
Why does it always…
Tell me
That you like me
That you need me
That you've never wanted me more
Baby feel my body
I'm not just somebody
To spend the night with when you're bored
Tell me
That you like me
That you need me
That you've never wanted me more
Baby feel my body
I'm not just somebody
To spend the night with when you're bored
Why does it always have to end with I love you… ?
