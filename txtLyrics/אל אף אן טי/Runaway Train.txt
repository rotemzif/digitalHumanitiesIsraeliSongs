I was one thousand stamens gliding through the air,
sometimes I brought you flowers, now you don't seem to care.
I was one thousand stamens in the air,
now, now I'm flying, I'll be out of your hair.
I'm going insane
I'm the one leaving, 
but you're a runaway train.
Runaway train.
You, you were my water & my dirt,
roots that grow deep under shaking earth.
Now, the winds are blowing somewhere else,
and I'm just one thousand stamens out of your hair.
I'm going insane
I'm the one leaving, 
but you're a runaway train.
Runaway train.
Runaway train...
