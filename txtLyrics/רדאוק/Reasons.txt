Yeah I have my reasons 
It would be a lie to say that you won’t understand 
This time is gone and I won’t cry for it 
But will you do it all again? 
A lie can last forever 
It doesn’t care that one has lost his way 
And all those years of healed regrets 
This open wound is here to stay 
And I wonder what if feels like 
Waking up without that bitter taste of loss 
Run through my chest 
Slowly forgetting my reasons 
All those dreams are meant for those 
Who never walked my way 
Now you’re getting smaller 
Now I’m fading life through glass again 
Now my mind is clearer 
Now I know it’s all the same 
My guilt is my own shadow 
My guilt is why I’m this way 
Drinking from the fountain and seeing myself 
Guess it’s time to walk again 
And I wonder what if feels like...
