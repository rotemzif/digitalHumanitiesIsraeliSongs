How come its cold in here 
Even when it's summer time 
As for you 
That's your last stop 
It's time to say good bye, 
How come its raining 
And the sky is blue and clear 
How come you're smiling 
When it's so so sad here 
It's a standard cliche, but damn so true 
It was supposed to be a happy song, you changed the plan 
Some people were meant to live 
But you had to rather give 
the leaves are falling well its mid December after all 
They seem so peaceful there 
Fading away disappearing 
Good bye my friend 
Fair well take care 
I'll see you when I die
