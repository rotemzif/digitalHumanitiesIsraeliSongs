Dancing makes you feel beautiful dancing makes you feel beautiful
Dancing makes you feel beautiful ..so beautiful …so beautiful
Roll your body up and down, turn your head all around
One two do the class, strip your body shape your ass
Right and left you got the touch, push your butt not too much
Show your legs... Your body rocks
Walk walk sexy walk it's physical your body talk
Walk walk sexy walk it's physical your body talk
Loosen up tease your face cause you're beautiful when you dance
Roll your body up and down and up and... turn your head all around all around...
Dancing makes you feel beautiful dancing makes you feel beautiful
Dancing makes you feel beautiful ..so beautiful …so beautiful
Dance my life I wanna fly to spend my time dancing
You watching me I dance for you and the rush is never ending
Breath the sound all around my body is on fire
I'm born to dance like no one else so put your hand higher
Dancing makes you feel beautiful dancing makes you feel beautiful
Dancing makes you feel beautiful ..so beautiful …so beautiful
I'm not your pussycat doll just love to shake with all the girls
So if you want to be my love come to my place
Cause you're beautiful when you dance
