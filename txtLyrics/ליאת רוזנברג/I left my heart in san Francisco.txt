The loveliness of paris 
Seems Somehow sadly gay,
The glory that was rome-
Is of another day…
I've been terribly alone,
And forgotten in manhattan…
I'm going home,
To my city by the bay.
I left my heart, in san Francisco…
High on a hill, it calls to me-
To be where little cable cars,
Climb halfway to the stars!
The morning fog may chill the air-
I don’t  care….
My love waits there,  in san Francisco…
Above the blue, and windy sea-
When I come home-
To you, san Francisco,
Your golden sun, will shine on me!
