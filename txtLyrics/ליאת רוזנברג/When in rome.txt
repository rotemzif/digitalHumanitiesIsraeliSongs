When in spain-
For reasons I don't explain
I remain enjoying a brew,
Don't deplore, my fondness for fundador,
You know how a fundador- can lead to a few….
And baby when in rome-
 I do as the romans do.
 If per chance, I'm saying farewell to france
And romance, drop in from the blue
Cherchez l'amour, I beg of you, please endure
My taking a brief detour, with somebody new
It's just that when in rome-
 i do as the romans do.
And though from Italy, I lied to you prettily
Oh don't think of me bitterly
But know that I'm true…
Except now and then in rome
I get that old yearn in rome,
And naturally when in rome-
I do as the romans do.
If I write happily-
 best wishes from Napoli
don't cable me snappily
to tell me we're through
'cause I'm once again in rome
In somebody's den in rome,
Well honey, but when in rome-
I do as the romans do.
If I write happily-
 best wishes from Napoli
don't cable me snappily
to tell me we're through…
'cause I'm once again in rome
In somebody's den in rome,
Well honey, but when in rome
I do as the romans….so just-
Disregard the signs and the omans
When in rome-
I do as the romans do.
