I Got to learn the truth before I learn how to lie.
I Got to learn the truth before I learn how to lie.
But this blues is gonna kill me before I die.
Sometimes I wonder about the future, sometimes I wonder about the past.
Sometimes I wonder about the future, sometimes I wonder about the past. Sometimes I wonder about the next thing, sometimes I wonder about the last.
Sometimes I'm blue, and other times I'm less.
Sometimes I'm blue and sometimes a little bit less.
But this blues is making, turning, turning my life into a mess.
I Got to learn the truth before I learn how to lie.
I Got to learn the truth before I learn how to lie.
But this blues is gonna kill me before I die.
