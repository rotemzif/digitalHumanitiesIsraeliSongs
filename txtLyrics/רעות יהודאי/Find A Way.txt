I must find a way to make it work
‘cause everyday I’m hanging on only leaves me weaker
And something inside is telling me to let it go
There’s no room for me in your crazy world
No reason left to linger
But I want your arms around me 
every time I’m feeling down
And I’m trying again to fight the will
of turning it all around
Broken hearted
All alone
And I can’t feel a thing now that you’re gone
And I’m so tired of fighting the tears
and all my fears that I’m running from
I try to let the sun come out of me like before
Though I realize it’s not the same -
when a piece in the game is missing
I won’t let myself be this weak anymore
I’ll get on again, walk through the pain
At least I’ll keep on trying
I see your face inside of every guy that smiles to me
And I wanna reach my hand for you again
But you’re not there to see
I’m broken hearted
All alone
And I can’t feel a thing now that you’re gone
And I’m so tired of fighting the tears
and all my fears that I’m running from
Now you wish me love
How can you wish me love
Baby, don’t you see?
When you wish me happiness
It’s the worst thing you can wish for me
‘cause this thing chose me
And you let me down after all
Now all I can wish for me 
is to break the fall
