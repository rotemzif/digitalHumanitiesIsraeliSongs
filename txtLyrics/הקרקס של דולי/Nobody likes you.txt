I'm not worried,
they don't know me here
am I dreaming?
I can fly I'm not afraid
This time I'll be fine
this time I'll be OK
someone will love me
and carry me home
Painful memories
once upon a time
thought he loved me
threw me on the ground and said
"Nobody likes you"
"Nobody cares if you're sad"
later my dad came,
and carried me home
God make them blind
God make them blind
