Beautiful lady I can feel you looking back at me
Through the smoke and the bitter drop
Under which I smile your way 
And I know you'll make me come to you like I'll make you
Want to stay …. Won't you stay…
Beautiful lady I feel you whispering I can taste your breath so sweet
As I hover over everything on the smoke beneath my feet
Open your gates call  to me lure me inside
 And I'll dwell in the chambers of your heart
As we taste some sweet waste of time together …waste some time together
Waste some time you and I… 
And we'll beg the dawn to stay asleep and I'll kiss you when we wake
We'll beg the dawn to slumber on ,for the light our love will take
Oh the drop as bitter as our mornings, as numbing as our nights 
The bitter drop as bitter as our mornings as numbing as our nights…
