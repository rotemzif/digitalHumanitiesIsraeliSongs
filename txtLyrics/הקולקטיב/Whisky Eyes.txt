Not quite sure what you were thinking 
Baby's dead, the clock is ticking 
Polaroids have faded long ago 
Real slim odds but still we're betting 
One more round of Lucky 7 
Better to be lost than be alone 
Whisky-eyes, oh, tell no lies 
Logic lane has flooded 
alleys 
Chinese rain on party armies 
Loud and screeching harpies on the loose 
Pucker up, you look delicious 
Bleed me dry with poker kisses 
Best of wishes, let me introduce 
Whisky-eyes, I wanna die by your side 
Whisky-eyes, oh, tell no lies 
Why do you lie so? 
Whisky-eyes, I despise - no goodbyes, no goodbyes, no goodbyes 
Women ever so promiscuous 
After hours advantageous 
Ever so courageous, Betty-Bones 
Frugal tea with Schopenhauer 
Dump the body in the shower 
Plato's cave ran out of flowers 
Ho, Ho, Ho!!! 
Whisky-eyes, I wanna die by your side 
Whisky-eyes, oh, tell no lies 
Why do you lie so? 
Whisky-eyes, I despise - no goodbyes, no goodbyes, no goodbyes 
Not quite sure what you were expecting of army brats and fortune telling 
Come on Lucky 7, bring me home 
Why do you lie so? 
Whisky-eyes, I despise 
No goodbyes, oh, Whisky-eyes 
No goodbyes, no goodbyes, no goodbyes
