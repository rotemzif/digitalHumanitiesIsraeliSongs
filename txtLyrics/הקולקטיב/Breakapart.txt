heart starts beating faster than the images that flash before your eyes 
chest is aching, then again it might be that the dress is just too tight 
and now the fun part's over, memories are honeytraps with no more cheques to cash 
i feel ready, years of crooked steadiness are foaming at the mouth and attack. 
heart stops bleeding, it radiates but who knows if it's left or was it right 
a slight distraction, you sensed it from the get-go but you can't go and there's no getting back 
and now a past time lover, wrecked and then recovered, hovers at the doorway and laughs 
and I can't stop feeling - funny how you let what kept you breathing to now eat you alive.
