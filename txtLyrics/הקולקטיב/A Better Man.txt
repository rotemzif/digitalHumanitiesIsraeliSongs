I hope you're breathing well and made it through the flight 
I hope you learn to sleep with all these flashing lights 
I hope your feet don't hurt, I hope they treat you nice 
I hope your teeth won't crack from chewing all this ice 
I hear you lost some weight, I bet you're feeling small 
I hear you did not hear anything at all 
I hear you're already here and you're not letting go 
I hear and can see quite clear how it ends up in tears, how it ends up in so and so... 
And please wake up a better man 
I know you want it too 
Turn the rust back into sand 
Please wake up a better man 
Or else just let me through 
I hope you can 
So let the bed bugs bite 'till they blood-let the night 
And when morning comes, let up, let down, put up a hell of a fight 
Hold still, if you will, try to think it through 
Hold still - it's just a thrill, the joy of killing you're addicted to 
Hold still - for what you spill is best served chilled but has no use 
So please wake up a better man, 
I know you want it too 
Turn the rust back into sand 
Please wake up a better man 
Or else just let me through 
I hope you can
