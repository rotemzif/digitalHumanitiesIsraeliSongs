No, I never heard her sing, 
Never wondered why 
No, I never meant a thing, 
Never even tried 
No, she never changed my ways, 
Just watched them swirling by 
I was so tired but never went to bed, 
There was always too much time 
We had a fast car for a steady pace 
We had to jump start, what was never dead 
And silver linings everywhere, apart from her crystal eyes 
Why they turn out oh-so-fair before they turn to cry?
