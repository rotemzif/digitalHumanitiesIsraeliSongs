Now that everything's done 
Now that you're meant to move on 
Week ends and so does the dawn 
Same beep - different tone 
Now that you've eaten too fast 
Traces of ghosts from the past 
Good friends sign on the cast 
Somethings weren't meant to last 
It takes time, permits and troubled minds 
It takes time to get back on track 
Now that your best is all tried 
Love lost and entry denied 
Mum says it's alright to cry 
Mum, she cries from inside 
It takes time, permits and troubled minds 
It takes time to get back on track 
Now that you've dried up your tears 
Made sure that everything's clear 
Weepings that turn into cheers 
Self-burnt stratosphere
