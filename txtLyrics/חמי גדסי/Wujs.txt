Hold your hands
Remove your fence
Let us sing
Instead of fight
Pray together 
All mankind
May the peace rule for those who are not fool
Love me baby, and I'll love you
Love me baby, and I'll love you
Open your heart
And smile
For hundreds
And thousands of miles
Use your brain 
And not your gun
May the peace rule for those who are not fool
Love me baby, and I'll love you
Love me baby, and I'll love you
Love me baby, and I'll love you
