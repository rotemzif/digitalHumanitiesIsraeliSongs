'yeah, Chan are you ready? 
I got this amazing story' 
I've seen the beauty of my life 
An amazing girl, 
It's crazy I don't know you know 
My feelings just grow. 
We're opposites but we attract 
You know I'm in to her, 
Living our world you and me girl. 
Yeah 
I've been thinking about you, 
Even in my sleep I'll be dreaming about you. 
It's everything about you 
Pretty and amazing, 
I'll make you my queen my heart I'm dedicating. 
Together in our world 
We don't got to be seen, 
Us against the world I know it sounds obscene. 
But I feel you 
And I know that you do too, 
That smile melts me 
Girl you're beautiful. 
Chorus (2X) 
So everyday I'm just like 
You're my heart and my soul, 
I'm the answer to your call 
You're the answer to my call. 
So together we won't fall 
Rise together and even more 
So I'll give you what you need. 
All these feelings inside me 
All I'm thinking is you, 
Everywhere that I go 
And everything that I do. 
I know it's complicated 
But I know we'll make it through, 
Just say you do girl 
Just say you do girl. 
I'll hug you 
And I'll never stop, 
Hold you high up to the sky 
Girl you'll never drop. 
I know you've been deceived 
But you gotta trust me, 
You've been through a lot 
I know it hurts trust me. 
Personality 
Like an angel from above, 
You're peaceful and pure 
Like a flying dove. 
She's gentle and demanding 
She's just so smart, 
I'll be with you forever 
Till death do us part. 
Chorus (2X) 
So everyday I'm just like 
You're my heart and my soul, 
I'm the answer to your call 
You're the answer to my call. 
So together we won't fall 
Rise together and even more 
So I'll give you what you need. 
Ey, cause you and me together 
Yeah we can reach the sky, 
Ups and downs smile and frowns 
Laughs and tearing eyes. 
Forever be your guy 
True story I won't play, 
You're aiming for my heart 
I collapse with words you say. 
So close your eyes 
Imagine what it can be, 
I'll make you feel secure 
Baby put your trust in mean. 
You shine like the stars 
You conquer my attention. 
You're sending out a signal 
I'm waiting for connection. 
I'm your protection 
A black night with shinning armor, 
Till you decide you're mine 
It's you who I'm searching after. 
And I mean every word 
Verse and chorus and every letter, 
Dedicated till you're mine, 
Loving you and it's forever. 
Chorus (6X) 
So everyday I'm just like 
You're my heart and my soul, 
I'm the answer to your call 
You're the answer to my call. 
So together we won't fall 
Rise together and even more 
So I'll give you what you need.
