Every time I close my eyes
And wonder how it could be
If I change myself
To love you more
Both of us must go
Through lessons in our lives
In order for our love to grow
There`s nothing in this world
That makes me shine
Like sweet pure love
As you know
No more war between us
No more war
No more rules to flip our brains
Only you ans me
No blame
Every time I close my eyes
And wonder how it could be
If I change myself
To love you more
Next time you`ll ask me why
I`m gonna tell you
That for now you`ll have to let me go
There`s nothing in this world
That makes me shine
Like sweet pure love
As you know
No more war between us
No more war
No more rules to flip our brains
Only you and me no blame
No blame
