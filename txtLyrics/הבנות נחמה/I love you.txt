Let me out let me out
Release my skin from this aching disguise
I'd like to be myself for a little while 
In this hole I'm all alone
I'm waiting for you to come and take me home
Into your loving arms I'll...
Fly... I Love you
Let me out let me out
See what I'm hiding inside
My heart is yours 
Till the day I'll...
Die... I Love you
