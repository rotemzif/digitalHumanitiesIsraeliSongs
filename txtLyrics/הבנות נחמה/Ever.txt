Woke up this morning
Checking out if my body is fine
Maybe I can use my legs to go out of my bed
To wash my face clear my mind
How come the sun is rising
And my soul so far behind
Second part of my day
And my bills are like Beverly Hills
And you know what it means
Trying to take my soul
And my talent is gone
Am I loosing it?
Am I loosing it all
That's why I say
Ever whenever, wherever the weather
Is stormy not goody flippy moody
A little bit ruddy
No need to be worry 
You can switch your life story
You give to someone else
Remember that you're not
The second best
And than another one come
Remember you're calm
That's why I say...
