woke up this morning 
with you on my side, 
no clocks to wake us 
no phones to interrupt 
the world might end tomorrow 
and i don't mind 
cause i've got you on my side 
let's take the dog out 
for a walk in the park 
the sun shines for us baby 
no reason to rush 
i'm not afraid to 
say that i love 
cause i've got you on my side
