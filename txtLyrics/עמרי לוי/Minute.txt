The minute i see you walk away 
i would die, 
can't live my life without you 
and see it falls apart, 
and all these song i wrote 
I didn't mean to hurt 
you darling. 
The minute i see you walk away 
I would die 
the words don't come so easy to me 
I can try, 
and all these lies I've said 
I didn't mean no hurt 
you darling
