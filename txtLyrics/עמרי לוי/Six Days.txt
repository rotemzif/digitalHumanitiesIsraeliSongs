Television's on again 
need a cigarette 
need a cup of coffee 
a girl to love and hate 
city makes me sick 
with all those phony smiles 
"oh ,what a lovely morning" 
"what a fucked up day you had at work" 
six days on the run 
from camden town to soho 
where am i today 
where we gonna be tomorrow 
city makes me sick 
with all those phony smiles 
"oh ,what a lovely morning" 
"what a fucked up day you had at work" 
go pack your life again 
the airplane is waitin', 
guitar on your back 
not sure where you are heading, 
airports make me sick 
with all those plastic emotions, 
"oh what a lovely day" 
"a lovely day to get out of here" 
six days on the run...
