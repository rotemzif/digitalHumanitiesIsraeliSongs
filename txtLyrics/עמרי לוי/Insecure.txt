Mom's cooking in the kitchen 
food will be served in just a few, 
finished your homework on time today 
got nothing else to do. 
feels good to be here 
so why do i look so sad 
feeling insecure about 
the way i live, the things I've said and done 
music has always been my best friend 
when i had no one else around 
even when the song stops at the end of every tape 
it always started again on the other side 
all my friends, where are they now? 
have i lost them all on the way 
got a few more in the back of my head 
the ones i miss are already the dead ones 
feels good to be here...
