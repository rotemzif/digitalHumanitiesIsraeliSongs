...be down in a second 
I might as well jump in to the pool 
I can't swim 
I'll probably drown - i am 
no good with questions 
I'll let you pave the road to an end, 
starting over - with somebody else, 
here i am - in your car 
driving into the night 
on the bridge -and you put on our favorite song 
i don't care - you can drop me from the edge of the hill 
it's nice that you've mentioned 
my falling downs, glad you were there 
stop the car cause you're 
driving me mad 
and we're getting nowhere 
this monologue of yours 
and me: sharing silence with you 
i've got nothing left to say. 
here i am - standing naked 
in front of the 
one i adore 
and i guess that you will never know, 
i don't care - you can go 
i'll be back on my own
