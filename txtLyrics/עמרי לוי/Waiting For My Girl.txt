The sun will shine tomorrow 
cause that's how i feel 
and everything will be th same 
except for my grin 
i will sing the song till i see your face 
I'm just waiting for my girl to come home 
got your letter, got your smile on my screen 
the phone call when you say you loved 
before we go to sleep 
i will sing the song till i see your face 
i'm just waiting for my girl to come home 
Got a new flat, got a bed i can share, 
enough milk in the fridge to make you 
coffee when you wake up, 
I'm not going anywhere, I'll be singing this song, 
while waiting for you to come home
