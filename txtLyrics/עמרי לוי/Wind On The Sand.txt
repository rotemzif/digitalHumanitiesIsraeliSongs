take a second to think 
what makes you feel 
what makes you lonely 
take a look in my eyes 
what do u see 
since when i'm your enemy 
don't you see im alive 
now that it's breaking apart 
and i know you'll be fine 
times when we couldnt share 
when you were scared 
to show what you feel 
inside your head there is some disease 
you know - it's killing me ,slowly 
and if i could face the pain 
no i will take it away 
and if i could sing again 
the angels will take me away 
and i know,you'll be fine. 
dreams like wind on the sand 
will fade away 
you know how i'd love to see 
you smiling ,reminds me 
of better ,better days. 
don't you see im alive 
now that it's breaking apart 
and i know you'll be fine 
if i could face the pain 
know i will take it away 
everything falls our way 
the angels would ask me to stay 
if i'd go back agggaaain 
you know i will bring back the pain ( I ) 
don't care what ppl say 
you know i can't love you that way
