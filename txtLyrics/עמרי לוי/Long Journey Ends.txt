Long journey ends 
i'm on the way back home 
a knock on the door ,she was waiting to see 
that you, haven't changed 
see that smile 
is it real or fake 
i've been to places i've seen many faces 
sadness and joy 
Memories, 
will not fade out 
a phone call from london reminds you of places 
where you belong 
i'll be alright,guess i'm doing fine 
i'll be alright, don't you worry
