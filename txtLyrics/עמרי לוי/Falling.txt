If i could stay one night with you, 
I'll show you that my love is true, 
Put on that Joni Mitchell song 
we'll dance all night don't worry 
i won't let you fall 
I'll be your man - tonight 
You don't have to talk, i understand, 
You don't need a lover ,just a friend 
I've heard this one before, you know 
i told you all about her, 
guess that i should go. 
stop the music - cause you don't deserve 
that Joni Mitchell song 
she's falling and she's falling 
she's falling 
I feel stupid 
to fall in love with you
