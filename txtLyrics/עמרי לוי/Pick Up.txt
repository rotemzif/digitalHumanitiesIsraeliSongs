pick up whatever's left 
'cause no one cares about you anyway 
every day - same old game 
can't get yourself out of bed 
you give up every day 
'cause every day locks you again and again. 
She will be back one day 
she cares about you in a way 
lie on the floor and wait 
she'll pick up whatever's left. 
You give up every day 
'cause every day locks you again and again 
'cause every pill fucks you again and again. 
and she won't be back 'till christmess... 
and she won't get out of your head
