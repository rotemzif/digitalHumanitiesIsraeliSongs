Dreams will be over 
crashing cars, rush hour 
you're back from work tired, 
these strange frightening lies 
will not ,be over 
till i tell the truth 
bout the way i feel 
bout the way i feel 
about you. 
Cars on the highway 
rush hour ,traffic jams 
one way to float 
one way to stay calm 
not thinking bout you 
keep myself busy all the time. 
Running like a cat 
sidewalks and trains 
be sure to check it 
one day i'll be ok. 
2 chords are enough 
to sing what i feel 
one is for sorrow 
the other for pain
