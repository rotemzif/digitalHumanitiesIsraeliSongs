in my bed where i lay my head 
lies the angel you've met at the pub 
she said why won't you take me home 
have a drink and talk... 
i'm not sure i remember her name 
guess i was too drunk to ask too sober to forget 
wish the morning will never come 
'cause it's too hard to see her go 
i wake up,she's gone 
a note by the telephone 
said,she had to go 
'cause she doesn't want him to know 
and i will never tell... 
god knows, how i hate waking up 
bed is too empty when i'm the only one inside 
she left her perfumes all over the room 
how am i going to forget? 
called her up - to see how she feels 
left a message on her machine 
hope the asshole will never know 
where she's been when she wasn't home
