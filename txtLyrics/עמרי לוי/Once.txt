leave those arms around me 
and keep that space so i can 
have the time to think about myself 
once,with you 
i remember good times 
how i was affraid to talk 
singing songs bout love 
made me think i don't know me anymore 
when i'm with u 
sit and talk it over 
or i might just take my stuff and go 
to a place where no one else will 
show up,staring at my heart 
going through my thoughts 
leaving me no where to hide 
no it's not your fault 
all i need is time 
i'm sorry that i've made u cry 
i'm so sorry that i've made u cry 
sorry that i've made u cry 
i'm sorry that i've made u cry
