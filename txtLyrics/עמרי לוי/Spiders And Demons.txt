Oh god,take that 
sound away from me 
spiders and demons 
in my bed 
where i should go? 
no one can see that 
even after all 
those nights away from home 
i'm not going back 
she said: 
"close your eyes now, 
i'm not here with you 
face that feeling" 
-oh god,i stumble and fall 
oh god where i should go 
no one can see that 
even after all 
those nights away from home 
i'm not going back 
to that place where you told me 
there is someone else 
waiting for you, 
you have to go 
and you left me standing there 
wishing you were lying again, 
call me tomorrow.
