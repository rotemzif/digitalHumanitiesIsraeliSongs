turn the televions off 
go to bed ,it's safe inside 
close the door 
and leave the stereo on 
the doctor said i'll be alright 
i don't believe his fucking lies 
these pills don't work, 
i can not feel myself 
the radio won't play my song 
and i don't care if 
it's the end of the world 
the end of the world 
tomorrow might be a better day 
happy tunes inside your head 
or it might be ,another 
silliy dream
