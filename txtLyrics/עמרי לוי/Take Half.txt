Always take half 
never spit it out 
loud as it gets when the lights go out 
we'll never be who we wanted to be... 
the banana moon looks so pale tonight 
and the black night is dusted. 
let's go for a walk, 
let's go for a while, 
empty cups on the dance floor, 
broken bottles,dizzy mind, 
you never felt better to leave me far behind
