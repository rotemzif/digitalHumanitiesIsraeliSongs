sun is shining 
let's get out of bed 
i don't wanna stay ---here all day 
i'll make the coffee 
you'll get the cigaretts 
then we'll look at each other and think 
why are we doint it to ourselves 
trying too much to make you laugh 
at the end of the day 
you keep forgetting that 
i love you 
evening comes 
and we agrue again 
about things we have agreed on yesterday 
then the tears roll down 
and i feel i'm dying inside. 
we go to bed and i hear you cry 
and i swear i don't wanna see you that way 
trying too hard to satisfy 
and at the end of the day 
we don't wanna do that 
i miss you. 
i am writing this song in my room at home 
now we're on owr own 
and we're happy again
