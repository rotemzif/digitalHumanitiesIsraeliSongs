Be careful what you say 
about thses early days 
i think i'm loosing it. 
Girls in a parade 
fireworks in hell 
the dream is over soon. 
god if this was true 
i would have been so 
different and happy - you know. 
Sittuation's bad 
can not hold your head 
above the water. 
Girls, they come and go 
like fireworks and snow, it will be over soon 
i wish i could film the things that i see 
when my eyes are closed 
every day's a dream 
nothing is 4 real 
open your eyes... 
....and now the parade is over 
you find yourself covered in mud 
and no one will show up tomorrow at work...
