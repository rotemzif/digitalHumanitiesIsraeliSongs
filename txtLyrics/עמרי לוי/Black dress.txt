I came here to see you, 
We have to talk about 
the things that made me hate you 
the things that on your mind. 
you know i used to love you 
back then you were so pretty 
wearing the black dress ,Saturday morning 
we were always on our way. 
...and then when something happened 
you knew that i'll be fine 
although you drive me crazy 
you always make me smile, 
you know i used to love you 
waited long long time 
for you to say you love me, 
for you to say "you're mine"
