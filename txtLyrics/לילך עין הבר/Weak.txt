i wanna write a song 
about how you changed 
my point of view 
i thought that you were strong 
i realized that you’re not 
i thought you were leading 
I was swept away 
by your assertiveness 
but then when you were gone 
i knew that I was wrong 
you’re so weak 
all the warmth a gave you 
was in vain 
it was too big for you to bear 
you turned a sweet thing into pain 
you’re so weak 
all the warmth a gave you 
was in vain 
it was too big for you to bear 
you turned a sweet thing into pain 
iI wanna tell you now 
how sad I am for you 
you seem to be so strong 
but actually you’re not 
you save yourself by leaving 
save yourself from love 
that’s all you ever do 
how will you find the truth? 
you’re so weak...
