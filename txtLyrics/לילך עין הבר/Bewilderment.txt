crazy sexy eyes 
are looking through 
my pink shirt 
as i realize 
i just don’t want to get hurt 
i’m floating, lighter than dust 
still i have no clue 
is it love or lust? 
luscious sexy lips 
are searching my heart 
through my pink shirt 
should i stay or should i leave? 
i just don’t want to get hurt 
i’m floating lighter than dust 
still i have no clue 
is it love or lust? 
bewilderment 
sometimes it’s just too hard 
so i let your warm hands wrap around my heart 
bewilderment 
sometimes i just give in 
so i let your warm thoughts 
travel up and down my skin 
sexy eyes 
are looking through 
my pink shirt 
as i realize 
i just don’t want to get hurt 
i’m floating lighter than dust 
still i have no clue 
is it love or lust? 
bewilderment...
