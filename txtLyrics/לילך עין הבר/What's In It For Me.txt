what’s in it for me 
what’s in it for me 
what’s in it for me 
tell me 
otherwise set me free 
you say you’re looking for 
a pretty lady 
you want her smart and fun 
and independent 
her career must be right on track 
and she’ll be ready to give you babies, too 
she should be wealthy- 
not after your money 
and get on really well 
with your mommy 
she’s gotta be very young 
yet experienced 
and she’ll always seem 
the perfect wife 
what’s in it for me... 
you want your lady to be 
a super-woman 
but not to think that she is one 
it’s better if she’s not too confident 
in case she starts to redefine 
what a relationship is all about 
now what’s your part in this, 
what’s your part? 
why is it o.k. for you 
to be only human 
when she should be 
more than a woman? 
what’s in it for me... 
you never make promises 
you make demands 
you’ll never put the best of you 
in your lover’s hands 
so tell me 
what’s in it for me...
