my grandpa 
wise and loved 
my grandpa is gone 
my grandpa sits in heaven 
seeing all that goes on 
tell me am i on the right track? 
grandpa, give me a sign 
just a bit of encouragement 
if you've got the time 
my grandpa 
loving and warm 
passed away long ago 
my grandpa always with me 
in my heart, wherever i go 
grandpa, tell me are you happy 
with who i have become? 
i really need your encouragement 
if you've got the time 
down come the tears 
washing away this song 
days become years 
but you never come along 
what is up there 
that ain't down here? 
i really hope they treat you well 
otherwise you should be near 
grandpa look, i'm all grown up 
i'm a woman now 
it was tough growin' up without you 
but I made it through somehow 
grandpa you know 
there have been times 
i wanted to join you so much 
but you came to me in my dream 
said "it is not your time" 
but now i don't even want to go 
'cause i'm happy here 
i really hope they treat you well 
otherwise you should be near 
down come the tears... 
down come the tears 
washing away this song 
days become years 
but you never come along 
what is up there? 
the unknownâ€™s my fear 
i really hope they treat you well 
otherwise you should be here
