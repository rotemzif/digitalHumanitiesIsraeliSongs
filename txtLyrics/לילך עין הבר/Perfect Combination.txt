i want to find love 
that’ll make me feel strong 
love has always made me 
feel weak 
i want to grow individually together 
i don’t want you to be 
the other half of me 
i just want to see you walking, smiling, next to me 
i want to feel free 
to love you 
while still loving 
everything about me 
i want to feel free 
to love you 
it’s the win-win situation 
the perfect combination 
i wish for 
i want to find love 
that’ll make me feel beautiful 
i want to be missed when i’m away 
i want to know 
that our love is invincible 
i don’t want you to be 
the other half of me 
i just want to see you walking, smiling, next to me 
i want to feel free... 
when you wrap me in your love 
i feel so secure 
i don’t want to lose 
my independence 
but i sure don’t want to lose you 
i want feel free….
