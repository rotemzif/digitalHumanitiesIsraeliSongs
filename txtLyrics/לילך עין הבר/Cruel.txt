if you think you’ve got the power 
to mess with my heart 
you might like to reconsider 
think it through tonight 
just before you start 
cause you might be surprised 
just because you could 
doesn’t mean you should 
be mean to me 
but if you insist 
i will not resist 
showing you my other me 
as much as you need me 
to punish you i say: no! 
i won’t be dragged into 
this game of yours 
i’ll just go 
if you think i’ve got the time 
to let you mess with my mind 
then you’ve lost the plot 
it seems like you want me 
to fill your unhealthy needs 
and make you satisfied 
as the days go bye 
you live a lie 
so pleasurably 
cause you’re such a fool 
then I must be cruel 
and stop this parody 
as much as you need me... 
as much as you beg me 
to punish you i say: no! 
iI won’t waste my time 
or my energy i’ll just go 
as much as you need me 
to punish you iI say: no! 
we both know you’re 
crazy about my body 
well, tough! 
watch me go…
