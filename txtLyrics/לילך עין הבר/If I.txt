if i die today 
or tomorrow 
and no one’s ever loved me before 
if i, ah, ah 
if i die today 
or tomorrow 
and no one’s ever loved me before 
if i die today 
don’t you sink in sorrow 
just cause no one’s ever loved me before 
if i, if i, if i 
if no one’s loved me yet 
and my life is cut? 
if i die today 
n’ tomorrow I’m gone 
would it really matter 
if i go alone 
if i love myself 
when i’m alive 
then i’ll love myself 
when i say goodbye 
i don’t define myself by the love i get 
loving oneself is a commitment for life 
it’d be nice to know that you love me too 
though i was born alone and i’ll die without you 
if i, if i, if i 
if no one’s loved me yet 
and my life is cut 
so fuckin’ what ?
