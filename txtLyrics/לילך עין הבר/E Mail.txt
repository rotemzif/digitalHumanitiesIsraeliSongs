“Leela, hope this e-mail finds you well. 
it’s causing me much pain 
this stupid dispute in your back-yard. 
i can not guess what it is like for you and your people. 
i’ve been dreaming vivid dreams about it, 
waking and, wondering on Friday the 13th. 
how the moon could be so full and white? 
it gets colder here by the day, 
tighter for me by the second 
as the pinch descends on my little business 
but i don’t think the sky is falling 
(i don’t think the sky is falling) 
you can check out my web site soon, 
big love, Joe”. 
“Joe Joe, things are pretty crazy here 
we try to keep on living, pretending 
nothing’s happening, though it’s so tough. 
traveled our country on a holiday, 
returned to hear of people killed 
by terrorists on the same road we drove on earlier. 
can’t help thinking it could be us. 
we’re not safe in our own home anymore. 
we hope peace will be here soon, no more victims, 
but after all the sun is shining 
(after all the sun is shining) 
much love to you too, 
Leela” 
”just thinking about you Leela, 
hoping you’re well and life treats you good, 
but there is madness out there at the moment. 
it’s shaking me to the core 
i feel the world’s so fuckin’ unstable 
what can we do? 
and where does it go from here? 
and how the moon could be so full and white? 
it gets colder here by the day, 
tighter for me by the second 
as the pinch descends on your little country 
but you will see the sky ain’t falling 
(you will see the sky ain’t falling) 
warmest thoughts to you kid 
and a big hug,Joe”
