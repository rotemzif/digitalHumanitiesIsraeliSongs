got a smile on my face 
but inside i cry 
my face will never show 
what i’m feeling inside 
i may look surrounded 
but i feel left out 
got a smile on my face 
but inside I cry 
my face will never show 
what I’m feeling inside 
i may look strong 
but there’s a pain in my heart 
everybody say’s: 
“boys don’t cry” 
and i always wanted 
equal rights 
that’s why i never cry 
everyone says: 
“big girls don’t cry, 
live up to the expectations!” 
l tried, and so i never cry 
got a smile on my face... 
maybe boys don’t shed a tear 
but that doesn’t give me equality 
just ‘cause i never cry 
imagine, if i let myself cry 
i might get someone 
who stands by my side 
still, I never cry 
everybody say’s:.. 
you need to be strong 
to lose control 
and you need to grow up 
to find the child in your soul
