i feel that i’m alive 
it makes me wanna dive 
into a deeper ocean 
i wanna feel the waves in my hair 
i need to go alone 
it makes me feel i’m strong 
when i’m in motion 
i feel it’s time i stopped checking if you care 
and when I’m settled down 
then you’ll come around 
and everything will turn upside down 
i’ll be the last to laugh 
‘cause you won’t get enough 
of me
