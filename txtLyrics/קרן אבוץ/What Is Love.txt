Here I stand, waiting 
Waiting for your love 
I give you all my days 
Though I may never find you 
Should I search forever? 
Dream of just one dream? 
And sacrifice a life 
Or should I, 
Leave my dreams behind me 
What is Love? 
If I can’t love you 
What are days (nights) for? 
When dawn brings nothing new 
What is Love? 
If I can’t love you (Without loving you) 
What are dreams for? 
If dreams can never come true 
Here I stand, waiting...
