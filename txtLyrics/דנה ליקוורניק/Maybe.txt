how could it be, when will we see 
nobody knows, for damn sure baby 
 maybe it's true 
 just me and you 
 running around without thinking of the time 
 cos' I'm trying to sleep 
 but your voice always speaks 
 calling my name  please stop because i don't need to hear a thing 
 and it's better if we'll just forgive 
 and move on 
 one day you'll wake up alone 
 and realize it's gone 
 Maybe someday 
 we will be here again 
 Maybe my baby someday we will 
 I lost my baby somewhere 
 But he will find me again 
    I'm not living , not lying there's no changing, no fighting , no screaming 
 No hurt in your side 
 I feel safe 
 and it's the best way for me to say 
 baby i just wanna stay 
    This time it's me...
