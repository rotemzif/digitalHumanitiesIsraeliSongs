I saw you walking down the street
I know you gonna be mine
I go to you say would you like to go to my apartment
Put some music, romantic oughtta be fantastic
I'll show you my magic
I have two magic fingers
I put 'em in your pocket
I have two magic, classic, fantastic, mega-elastic fingers
And you go like ahhh ahhh ahhh
I'm the rasta-man Lumumba sitting in the sun
Waiting you to go down I wanna have some fun
Yellow is for sunna, red is for blodda, green is for grassa
Flaga of the rasta
I have two magic fingers
I put 'em in your pocket
I have two magic, classic, fantastic, mega-elastic fingers
And you go like ahhh ahhh ahhh
