I've never come first
i always come second
i never had the taste 
of winning
and like a bleeding animal 
i became prey
to people who think they 
are better
so the rage, it fills my veins
but i won't let it stain
my soul 
yes the rage, it lives inside of me 
but i wonâ€™t let it stain
my soul
because I'm better than you'll ever be
and I'm better than i've ever been
i'm beating you at your own game
yes I'm better than you'll ever be
and I'm better than i've ever been
i'm beating you at your own game
they all run fast
now I'm running faster
all those years of pain 
were worth it 
i'm still bleeding hard 
but my wounds are healing 
and I'm not afraid 
of dreaming
and the rage, still fills my veins
but i won't let it stain
my soul 
yes the rage, it lives inside of me 
but i wont let it stain
my soul
because I'm better than you'll ever be
and I'm better than i've ever been
i'm beating you at your own game
yes I'm better than you'll ever be
and I'm better than i've ever been
i'm beating you at your own game
