Come on young believer where the magic is alive 
Word is out and finally the monster's done 
Unlock the pressured drivers to unfold a softer ride 
Whistle some songs that use the words of love 
In June I'll be tired so I'll take longer coffee breaks 
Sweets keep 'em smiling when their love is sugarless 
The scent of reminiscence has been sprayed into the open air 
Hold your breath, close your eyes and don't look back 
Bells striking madly they can lead things to a better spot 
Whistle some songs that abuse the words of love 
In June I'll be tired so I'll take longer coffee breaks 
Sweets keep 'em smiling when their love is sugarless
