Too many organs
Too many sounds, a total mess
We lose the focus
So bring in order 
Need to think
Count on instincts
Just because it's so complex
A crucial moment 
This one can make the system breathe
Too many organs
Too many sounds
I don’t mind listening
But I'll do it through my ears
I'll cross the world and see
If it takes days or even years
But the feeling's good so now
Let's keep it quiet
Many organs 
Each one has a special place
Taking orders 
Knowing only to obey
Can feel the presence
That controls us perfectly 
Two four eight organs
Raise our hands 'cause we believe
Many organs
Taking orders
I don’t mind listening
But I'll do it through my ears
I'll cross the world and see
If it takes days or even years
But the feeling's good so now
Let's keep it quiet
