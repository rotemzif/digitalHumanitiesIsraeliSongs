Look at him 
The black sheep
Standing out on all four feet
Full of life 
And free to run
The sound of drums 
The sound of loud drums fading out
The phone calls
The pictures
The voices
Never leave you
The stop signs and warnings
Why turn away?
Two miles away and you're in paradise
Two miles away and some great memories
Near the end 
The words turn soft
Hope to find
Some peace of mind
Somewhere then 
Along the line
The feeling was 
Feeling nothing can be done
The phone calls
The pictures
The voices
Never leave you
The stop signs and warnings
Why turn away?
Two miles away and you're in paradise
Two miles away and some great memories
Holding on to crumbs of glory
Even this is done with style
Two miles away and you're in paradise
Two miles away and some great memories
Away and you're in paradise
