Forest woods, they knew to chop off his right arm 
They said it did him harm, losing all his charm 
He stays awake and looks at branches painted green 
As if he needed peace, counting all the leaves 
The screaming of the mad machines 
Come at night into the dreams 
Oh my, no more, beautiful sunsets 
Whisper, whisper, words of prayer 
Fight the spirits in the void 
Flip two dead eyes open 
Sun shines, sun dies, who’s heart is broken? 
The trees are happy they can stay there in the wind 
Learning to give in, confessing to the sin 
Recycled paper saving most of forest’s aunts 
Finding the solution to the life of those poor plants 
Life inside the nevergreen 
The search for new dimensions 
Oh my, no more, beautiful sunsets 
Whisper, whisper, words of prayer 
Fight the spirits in the void 
Flip two dead eyes open 
Sun shines, sun dies, who’s heart is broken? 
Let yourself out of this trip 
Acting like a lunatic 
It’s time to carry on… 
Whisper, whisper, words of prayer 
Fight the spirits in the void 
Flip two dead eyes open 
Sun shines, sun dies, who’s heart is broken
