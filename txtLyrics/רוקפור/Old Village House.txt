out and about 
wearing my polo shirt tight 
think it looks nice asking around 
chasing the world 
driving a stock motorbike 
it's just right for now I used to know why 
old village house I see the plants have grown so high 
old village house I need to catch the morning flight 
old village house I'll be back, won't neglect you 
bye for now 
off for a while 
my feet in the lukewarm swimming pool 
buying some time - so good at that 
old village house I see the plants have grown so high...
