Alright for your eyes only 
No risk damn good for real 
What goes may never come again 
The wheel of fortune spins 
Oh soon he smiled it's gold 
I sometimes see him waiting for the train 
What goes around may never come around ya 
The wheel of fortune took me for a ride 
So here am I left to save those dimes now 
In fact the pennies have new meaning too 
What goes around may never come around ya 
the wheel of fortune spins into this dream 
Alright for your eyes only 
No risk damn good for real 
What goes may never come again 
The wheel of fortune spins 
Don't run away 
What goes may never come again 
The wheel of fortune spins
