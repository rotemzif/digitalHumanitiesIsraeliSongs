Do I need to send you flowers? 
Will it give us hope? 
Through the streets I've walked for hours 
With my endless thoughts 
Can you hear me when I'm talking? 
I seem to speak so loud 
But this is getting boring 
Golden girl is gone 
There's so much more in life 
This is a soundtrack of a silent dream 
Freak shows of our life 
It's under our skin 
We never seem to get it off 
So you filled your head with monsters 
Up and down the two-world lane 
Running through the sales 
See your face again 
It's hell for me 
Do I need to send you flowers? 
Will it give us hope? 
Through the streets I've walked for hours 
I'm the super scope 
This is a soundtrack of a silent dream... 
This is a soundtrack of a silent dream 
Freak shows of our lives 
Gomenasayi 
We never seem to get it off 
Freak shows of our livesâ€¦
