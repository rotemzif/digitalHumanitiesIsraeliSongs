A place where wishes and reality meet
Celebrate the games 
Dump your body onto burning flames
Turn it on 
Dirty water won't be here for long
Paint it black 
Censored rainbow keeps a mouth shut
Inside there's a race with no winner
Run away from Champagne on ice
History will show him no favor
Staring at the melting time
Waiting for the stars to shine
Powered by the dream 
When logic has no vacancy 
A one night stop 
Soon becomes a lifetime
Inside there's a race with no winner
Run away from Champagne on ice
History will show him no favor
Waiting for the stars to shine
