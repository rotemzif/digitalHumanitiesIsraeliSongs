Route six six six - end of the line 
Come a little closer - soon it starts 
Far away calling you from above 
"Let the horses run!" 
Stop! Stop running there is nowhere to hide 
Catch you now Iâ€™m not far behind 
Hang it up, push it down 
Forget the voices in your head 
"Let the horses run!" 
If it all were going right 
Then you would be so far 
Lonely riders would show you how 
To let the horses run 
Have you seen them in your eyes? 
Let me introduce you to some friends of mine 
If you were wrong they soon will come 
Forget the voices in your head 
"Let the horses run!" 
If it all were going right...
