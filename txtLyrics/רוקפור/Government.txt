Unhappy chords you better count the seconds 
It's gonna crack, collect the dirty matters 
Surrender to the old addictions 
Look at yourself, a copycat with no religion 
That's what you are 
The choice you've made within the circumstances 
Citizen Kane, you are like stormy weather 
Electric heads and fashion t-shirts 
No acts of innocence 
Your face is on the television 
Look what you've done 
The blame's on everyone! 
Here it goes again 
Isn't it time to change the government? 
Here it goes again 
Isn't it time to find our innocence? 
The money's gone, the money's gone 
You better switch off the lights 
Look out, you'll never make it 
Using only escalators, private airplanes 
A twisted life of contradictions 
It's suicide 
the blame's on everyone! 
Here it goes again 
Isn't it time to change the government? 
Here it goes again 
Isn't it time to find our innocence? 
Automatic information 
Fast communications turning right 
Pornographic windows 
Hell, you are approaching fast to second twenty-one 
Here it goes again...
