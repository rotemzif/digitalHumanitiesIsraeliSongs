like animals so insecure 
biting on the high waves 
warning threads they want ahead 
into the wall of sound 
corridors for the self assured 
still pacing on the sidewalk 
all at once turns around 
with language never heard 
corridors are not for all 
this could have saved a soul 
and it's far behind 
I never have to see your face again 
valued thoughts make up for hurt 
that could've had this long gone 
money spent and crooked debts 
are soon to be forgotten 
cause corridors are not for al
