Way back someone came into my life 
Approaching me 
Hey stranger do you have a light 
Found some matches he tapped my helping hand 
Someday you'll be thankful for this thing you've done 
Obviously, so intrigued 
was an important deal to learn more about this 
Seconds later standing all alone 
Where Broadway meets with Bond St. felt like chewing gum 
Fingered out as some unlucky guy 
Suddenly it hit me he was a mirrored I 
Obviously, so intrigued 
was an important deal to learn more about this 
Half was he and a reflection of me 
Too bad for him his part was crying 
Anomalies said got released 
Get us through different aisles 
Come and see evil free 
Meet the perfect person 
as we talk sensibly 
With passion now unleashed 
all the same have your doubts 
Call me one track minded 
Take control of your acts 
I guess you can't believe 
I know you're hurting
