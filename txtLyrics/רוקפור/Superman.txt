Soon they said the end is beginning 
Green fields are turning to red 
No mistake, the devil’s arriving 
Astroids are falling like blades 
Who’s on the bridge? 
Set the time 
Have you returned once again? 
God, we’re lost living in a loop 
Some things are faster than us 
We love stars just like superman 
And we’re hiding the tears when he flies 
Are we sparks, the already made? 
And we’re craving for roses and wine 
Diamond eyes, pushing hard, overdrive 
Scary games 
Most of us dreaming of being the perfect machines 
Who’s on the bridge? 
Set the time 
Have you returned once again? 
Is it the end or a start? 
Oh, please don’t press ‘erase’ 
join us and play a new game 
We love stars just like superman
