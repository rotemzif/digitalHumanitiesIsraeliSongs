Is it all about the powers 
That the bees come to the flowers? 
Yes I know, yes I know 
Do I really need to bother 
And to look for the other? 
I don’t know, I don’t know 
It’s over and out 
And it all comes to an end… 
I think so! 
And you gave me no good reasons 
God, you know this isn’t easy 
Well I know, yes I know 
Is it all about the secrets? 
No one ever knew the frequencies I know 
Yes I know 
And it all comes to an end… 
I think so!
