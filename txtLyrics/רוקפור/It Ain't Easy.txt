first thing that I thought of when I saw you walk away 
was how could someone run so fast on high heels 
must have been the neighbors saying 
baby he's a mess 
look for something better 
you deserve it 
it ain't easy when you're gone 
it ain't easy 
next thing that I noticed made my throat go cotton dry 
empty liquor bottles in the cabinet 
how was I supposed to pass the day? 
nothing here will take the thirst away 
it ain't easy when you're gone 
it ain't easy
