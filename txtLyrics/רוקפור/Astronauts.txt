Long before the astronauts, the Soviets and the science 
Never thought to end up on a soft-pack full of lies 
All across the land of ours the future is exciting 
Hard to find the words to fit inside this silly line 
We can't decide who is on our side 
Signals from the past that all the papers keep denying 
Pre-historic bones still have a story to be told 
Long before the astronauts, the Soviets and the science 
Never thought to end up on a soft-pack full of lies 
We can't decide who is on our side
