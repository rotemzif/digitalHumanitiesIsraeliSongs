It’s easier today to start it all again 
With you 
A dream it could have been captured in a film 
With you 
Days I’ve spent alone, believing you will rescue me 
It’s true I can’t control myself 
Hey you, hang on to fairy tales 
With you I have never felt so good 
Supermarket 
Escort girls 
Late shows on t.v. 
Sixty minutes 
Is all I really want from you 
so easier today, yeah, we could start it all again 
You tell me what is wrong 
Just what am I supposed to be? 
It’s true I can’t control myself 
Hey you hang on to fairy tales 
With you I have never felt so good 
It’s been so long…
