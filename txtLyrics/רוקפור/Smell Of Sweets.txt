I'm so happy I'm crying 
Deep down I know it's too late 
Why, oh why it's a dream 
Smell the sweets 
Shiny faces you liars 
Is it the American dream? 
Touch the sky it's a deal 
Smell of sweets 
Everyday when it's over and over again 
Put my face on 'Smile!' 
Get out of my bed 
Twelve's the estimated arrival 
She keeps on promoting pain 
Touch the ground she's so real 
Smell of sweets 
Everyday when it's over and over again 
Put my face on 'Smile!' 
Get out of my bed, yeah 
Back to yesterday on an aeroplane 
In the peak of rush hour 
You ask yourself why 
I'm so fragile 
Tell me what's wrong 
Smell of sweets 
(I'm so happy I'm smiling)
