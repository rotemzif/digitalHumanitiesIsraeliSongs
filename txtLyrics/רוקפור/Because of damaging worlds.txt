maybe because of the damaging words 
we won't be back 
to finish the apple pie 
peel it off and only the love 
a white element means nothing alone 
we have passed scary moments 
but never crossed the rubicon 
from your face I don't see 
sorry 
so I'll take the couch for tonight 
maybe because actions have caused us 
to hear the song 
we loved to ignore 
daring to draw 
yes you have the balls 
you won't pretend or leave it to boil
