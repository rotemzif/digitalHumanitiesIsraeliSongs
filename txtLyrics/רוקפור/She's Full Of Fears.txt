Have you a moment to listen to this? 
One opportunity you’ll never miss 
Oh, it disappeared 
And it won’t be coming soon 
Blesses and prayers kept locked in a chain 
Fist letting go till it’s time to return 
And she’s full of fears 
And forever they will stay 
Tell me a story 
Give me some hope 
One for tomorrow 
When she’s full of fears 
Angels, angels, around in her head 
Till it collapsed then she forgets 
For years after years 
Now they have met, not face to face 
Still it’s so hard to be held and embraced 
Cause she’s full of fears 
And forever they will stay 
Screaming sirens came near you 
It’s inside 
And after all this time she meant to fly 
For years after years she has kept it in inside 
But still she couldn’t find her way out 
She’ll stay, oh man, she’ll stay to get it done 
Have you a moment to listen to this? 
One opportunity you’ll never miss 
And she’s full of fears…
