SeatBelts are locking 
The count is just about to begin 
Strange yet so beautiful 
Will I ever see you again? 
Came uninvited 
Security was right on our tail 
Still these reminders 
Maybe you'll arrive to connect 
Oh, turn in on, turn it on 
Play it loud before it's gone 
Yet I wish you'd find a home 
Carry on, carry on 
Slightly distorted 
Serenity was not to be found 
Deep in the traffic jam 
Somehow I will find my way out 
Oh, turn in on, turn it on 
Play it loud before it's gone 
Yet I wish you'd find a home 
Carry on, carry on 
Turn it on, turn it on
