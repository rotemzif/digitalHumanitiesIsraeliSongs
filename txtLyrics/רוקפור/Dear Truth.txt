Dear truth you are responsible 
you're to blame in every way 
'cause after all I wasn't made for this 
after all no one was made for this 
Had enough of all this underground 
heads up for the new religion 
cause after all I wasn't made for this 
after all no one was made for this 
Never pointed dirty fingers 
never called you awful names 
cause after all I wasn't made for this 
after all no one was made for this 
Pushing you need answers 
Got a heaven of our own 
And there's nothing left to breath for 
Still we dig into the bone 
Watching you forever 
Got some questions, so involved 
And there's nothing left to breath for 
Still we dig into the bone
