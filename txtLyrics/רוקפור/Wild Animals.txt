I feel the change 
A million ways to turn the page 
"No way!" she said 
I thought you knew it wouldn't last for long 
And I just don't know 
Well, I don't know why you came 
It never ends, I keep forgetting what you hate 
Don't say - 
Goodbye my love 
Cause I don't wanna leave you 
Tonight let out your phobia 
Goodbye my love 
Always did believe in a crash, we're like 
Wild animals 
So fast I've lost today 
But I'll be on track again 
And I just don't know 
Well, I don't know why you came 
It never ends, I keep forgetting I'm to blame 
But I feel the change 
Killed the rage 
Keep forgetting what you hate 
Don't say - 
Goodbye my love... 
And if you meant to move ahead 
Goodbye 
I won't mind 
And if you have another half 
Goodbye 
I'll let go of everything
