one day you're looking for me 
the second day you're not 
one time you're pornographic 
but then you say I won't 
I get a bad reaction everywhere I go 
completely out of line 
this is not a war 
someday when you're looking for me 
a second time's so wrong 
don't try to dance this ballroom 
it's said to bring no luck 
I get a bad reaction everywhere I go 
completely out of line 
this is not a war 
I don't feel the need to leave 
so I sit at home and listen 
to a favorite tune 
don't worry baby
