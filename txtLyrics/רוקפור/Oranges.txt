Come eat oranges with me 
Peel them with your fingers 
Down where people cannot see 
Let yourself go free 
Light is out and suddenly 
The feeling of your touch 
It’s ten-past-six and you’re asleep 
I’ll wipe away your foolish grin 
Time is running and I know 
I need to get out of this maze 
To find what’s written in the cards 
Or am I going insane? 
Then again… 
Grey’s the color in my mind 
Never black and white 
A thousand shades before my eyes 
Afraid of almost anyone 
Come eat oranges with me... 
Time is running and I know... 
Grey’s the color in my mind... 
But now I’m tired, I can’t go on 
Don’t want to wake up and return 
Grey’s the color in my mind...
