Five a.m, just woke up, drank my coffee 
Well I'll never go to work again 
Too many cars with too many people 
It's not for me this game 
Earth is loosing its temper 
Forests of unforgotten dreams 
While the hanged-man is turning 
I can see your face in between 
Your starlight flies 
Your starlight flies with a song 
Has it ever been better? 
Or was it just a state of mind 
The united grace of unconsciousness 
Plays with the Middle East on flames 
Wars from hell knock on my window 
And I can still be your best man 
All the religions, all the insane 
I can hear your voice through the remains 
Your starlight flies 
Your starlight flies with a song 
And suddenly a stop -
