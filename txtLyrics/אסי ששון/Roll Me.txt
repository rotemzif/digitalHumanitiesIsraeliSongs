Roll me roll me on my back
Play me play me with your hands
Save me save me from my self
Hang me hang me with your common sense
But I can hardly see beyond your eyes
As far as reaching hand but it’s a thousand miles
Ohh I need your smile…
Roll me roll me im here, here
Hide me hide me before I disappear
Give me give me im all yours
Hill me hill me with your tiny gloves
But I can hardly see beyond your eyes
As far as reaching hand but it’s a thousand miles
Ohh I need your smile…
Cause I can not stare back I am blinded by
A look that dosent need to know
But wonders why
I need your smile..
the river flows and its stil rains - im your little man
