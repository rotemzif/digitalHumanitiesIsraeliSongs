Someday you will fly too 
And when you do, it will happen 
You know 
we'll see through 
I feel blue, I see you 
It's all true… It will happen 
You know love is true 
Spread your wings and leave the ground 
Drifting home without a sound 
Please don't make me try to hide 
Take me to the other side 
I feel blue, I see you 
It's all true… It will happen 
You know love is true
