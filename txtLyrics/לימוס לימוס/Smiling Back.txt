We can take you home 
And if you wish 
Home may be the clouds 
Or swimming with a fish 
Bottled candles in the dark 
Feeding off our bearing scene 
Pictures of a chandelier 
Smiling back 
And whispering your name 
We can take you up 
And spread our wings 
Up may me down 
Or riding on our swing 
Sleepless angels on our side 
Making up for crashing dreams 
Daisies on your window pane 
Smiling back 
And whispering your name
