As the night keeps falling 
Violet and blue 
Can you hear me calling 
Standing next to you 
Now the dawn is breaking 
Majesty and fame 
Please don't be mistaken 
As nothing stays the same 
Orange, Blue, Green, Yellow, Red, Purple 
My head is spinning all around 
Move me up without a sound 
Please donâ€™t 
ask me what I've found 
Colors flying all around 
Take your love above the 
ground 
I believe you know how 
Time can bend your heart 
Lay your head 
and sleep now 
Every end is a start
