She can carry him down 
With one touch 
Stop spinning around 
She stands on two feet 
Needing no weapon 
Just her reach 
Bring yourself down 
She will throw feathers on your body 
He feels so wrong 
Coz he won't ever miss nobody 
Tell her if you mind 
Taking chances 
wasting time 
Don't break if you realize 
You can't have all you are 
Bring yourself down...
