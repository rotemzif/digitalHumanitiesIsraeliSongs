It's time you count my blessings 
All in one hand 
And burry my watch in the sand 
Rain came and went, 
time wisely spent. 
And while weâ€™re here 
We try to see 
The angels we thought we should be 
Gliding down the slope 
like a cushion full of hope 
(Now I can see The 
angel I thought I should be 
Am I being him or is it me) 
The sooner you're waken 
The better you'll be 
I guess you may say that about me 
As I slip into 
rhyme with a mild trace of lime 
(Now I should be 
The angel I thought I could see 
Am I being him or is it me)
