You better teach me what to say 
You lay your mantras on a tray 
And now it 
seems I've come this far 
Just to see how near you are 
Have I become your lightning seeker 
Or am I just a secret keeper 
Crawling up on your freckled spine 
Suck up to your sweet sacred vine 
Babe I wanna give you all I got 
right now 
Now Now Now 
Songbird feathers, pitch black wings 
Holding up with my magic strings 
But love turned to dust and dust turned to art 
Me chewing on your sonar heart 
Babe I wanna give you all I got 
right now 
Now Now Now
