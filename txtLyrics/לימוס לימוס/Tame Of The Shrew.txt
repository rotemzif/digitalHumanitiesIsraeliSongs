All over town 
There's a rumor coming down 
You're finally back, 
and what's in your pack 
In this a heart full of slack 
You're such a geek 
Would you make me join your fleet? 
Anyone who wants to be you 
Is welcome to chew 
Easy to do 
Oh and it's such a sight, 
creep into my bed at night 
I'd rest my head and sigh, 
now we can fly. 
I'd give and take 
For my sacred mushroom's sake 
You're finely through, end of part two 
Tame of the shrew 
Oh and it's such a sight...
