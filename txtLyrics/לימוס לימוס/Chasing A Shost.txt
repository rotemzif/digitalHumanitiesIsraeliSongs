I've been on a train for all my life 
I've been chasing a ghost. 
But there's one thing which 
Will never change 
And that's another doorway 
There's no other way 
So we're here to stay 
Countless shooting stars for all my life 
Keep me hanging on. 
But there's one thing which 
Will never change 
And that's another doorway 
There's no other way 
So we're here to stay
