Still remember, cannot forget the flower in your hair. 
Looking forward listen to my heart 
Listen and shed a tear 
Chorus: 
Waiting for you long time baby was so hard for me to do, 
Me and you forever we'll be one but now you're gone 
And I, still remember cannot forget the brightness of your smile 
Soft embraces the look into your eyes 
The whisper in my ear 
Chorus: 
Waiting for you..
