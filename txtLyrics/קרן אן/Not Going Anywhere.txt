This is why I always wonder, I'm a pond full of regrets
I always try to not remember rather than forget
This is why I always whisper when vagabonds are passing by
I tend to keep myself away from their goodbyes
Tide will rise and fall along the bay
And I'm not going anywhere, I'm not going anywhere
People come and go and walk away
But I'm not going anywhere, I'm not going anywhere
This is why I always whisper, I'm a river with a spell
I like to hear but not to listen, I like to say but not to tell
This is why I always wonder, there's nothing new under the sun
I won't go anywhere so give my love to everyone
Tide will rise and fall along the bay
And I'm not going anywhere, I'm not going anywhere
People come and go and walk away
But I'm not going anywhere, I'm not going anywhere
