You wake up in a morning 
And you see the sky
Trying hardly to be civil to yourself
Can you ever be happy you?
Did you ever imagine nice things around you like a sweet bird on a tree?
I don’t want to hurt you 
Just two people loosing
Their minds
I don’t want to miss anything of you
So please
Smile 2 me
Smile 2 you
Keep smile 2 you, smile 2 me, smile
Keep, smile 2 you, smile 2 me, smile
Keep smile 2 you, smile 2 me, smile
Keep smile 2 you, smile 2 me…
Darkness makes you forget what beauty is
Gray thoughts leave you out of happiness
You wandering firefly in daylight, that’s the only way to keep you away, it keeps you away from me, way from me
Away from me, just two people loosing their minds
I don't want to miss anything of you
So please smile to me, smile to you 
Keep smile 2 you, smile 2 me, smile
Keep smile 2 you, smile 2 me, smile
Keep smile 2 you, smile 2 me
Keep smile 2 you, smile 2 me, smile
Keep smile 2 you, smile 2 me, smile
Keep smile 2 you, smile 2 me, smile
Keep smile 2 you, smile 2 me
