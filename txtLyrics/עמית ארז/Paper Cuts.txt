THE SOUND OF DECEMBER’S FREEZING WIND HAS APPEARED 
YOU’D THINK IT’S THE LOUDEST THAT WE’VE HAD HERE IN YEARS 
I GOT YOU A PRESENT MADE OF SALT AND PAPER CUTS 
MY OWN MOLDED EMBER WITH GLANCING EYES 
AND MORNING DUST 
SPARKS IN MY PALM 
IS IT RAIN 
IS IT RAIN 
SEEMS NOT SO HARD 
TO PRETEND 
TO PRETEND 
THE ROOF BLOCKED THE WATER 
FROM POURING IN ON OUR HEADS 
THE WALLS BLOCKED THE SUNRISE 
FROM STRETCHING WIDE ON OUR BED 
REMEMBER THAT ASHTRAY 
WITH THE EIFFEL TOWER STAMPED UPON IT 
SO CORNY AND COMMON 
AND YET IT HAD A CERTAIN CHARM 
SPARKS ON YOUR ARM 
THAT’S NOT RAIN 
THAT’S NOT RAIN 
LEFTOVERS FROM THAT ONE TIME 
WHEN WE DANCED 
MARSHMALLOW DINNER 
MELTING COLORS ON A STICK 
I MERGED THE DIVISION 
THE WHITE OF HEALTH 
THE PINK OF SICK 
MUST STAY ALIVE WHEN YOU COME TO COLLECT 
ALL THAT I’VE EARNED BY MISTAKE 
BY MISTAKE
