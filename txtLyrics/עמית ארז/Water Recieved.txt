IMMERSED IN THE ECHO 
OF LIGHT IN THE LEAVES 
I SANK IN THE WATER 
AND THE WATER RECEIVED 
CONSTANTLY HUMMING 
IT SWALLOWED ME DOWN 
I HEARD YOU ARE COMING 
COMING AROUND 
TOUCH ME WITH YOUR THIGHS 
WHEN I AM INSIDE 
TOUCH ME IN THE EYES 
THEY'RE TIMID AND DRY 
I'M SEEING MY MOTHER 
CROUCHED ON THE GROUND 
MY FATHER AND BROTHERS 
THEY DIG IN THE SUN 
I'LL WAKE UP TOMORROW 
LOOKING THE SAME 
AND CLIMB UP THE NARROW 
HALLWAY AGAIN 
TOUCH ME WITH YOUR THIGHS... 
THE FIRST FLOOR HAS A STONE 
PRESSING ON MY BARE BONES 
THE SECOND FLOOR HAS A TREE 
SPREADING UP ABOVE ME
