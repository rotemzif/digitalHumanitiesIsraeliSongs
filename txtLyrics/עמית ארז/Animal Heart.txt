OH BABY CANE 
I WAS BORN TO HOLD YOU 
AND IF I FALL 
I'LL HAVE SOMEONE TO BLAME 
I FEEL LIKE A SINNER BUT IT'S OK 
OH BABY CANE 
I WAS LONG BEFORE YOU 
ALL THIN AND TALL 
AND FULL OF BLOODY SHAME 
THE HOUR'S AGAINST ME BUT I'M OK 
IT'S GONNA TAKE A HURRICANE 
TO GET ME MOVING 
ANIMAL HEART 
TO PUMP MY BLOOD AWAY 
IT'S GONNA TAKE A HURRICANE 
TO GET ME MOVING 
ANIMAL HEART 
ANIMAL HEART 
WHAT STRIKES ME DOWN 
AS A CONTRADICTION 
IS THE SPEED OF LIGHT 
IN WHICH YOU MOVE AHEAD 
I WISH I COULD FOLLOW BUT I'M TOO SCARED 
WHEN PAIN'S APPLIED 
WITH NO RESTRICTION 
I'M EITHER COLD OR HOT ENOUGH TO STAY 
THERE'S ALWAYS AN ANSWER WHY I'M NOT THERE 
IT'S GONNA TAKE A HURRICANE...
