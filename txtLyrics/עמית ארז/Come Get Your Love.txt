two bodies down 
my love is wasted 
no reward, no reward 
I tried to learn 
your secret sorrows 
all you know 
all you know 
come get your love 
it's been a while 
you keep on heading for the ground 
such a cold 
such a cold 
this is your art 
to push away from everyone 
stay alone 
stay alone 
I guess you'll never know 
how much you're missed 
it cuts the soul 
come get your love
