WE CAN PLAY THE PART 
OF ANCIENT SECRET CARDS 
BLANK TO THOSE WHO 
NEVER HAD A HEART 
WE'LL NEVER LOSE OR GAIN 
THE DEALER MADE US SMALL AND PLAIN 
TRUST MY INSTINCTS 
NO ONE WILL BE BLAMED 
AND EVEN THOUGH I'M SCARED 
TO PUT A FLOWER IN YOUR HAIR 
I'LL HAVE TO PLANT A STAR 
TO ALWAYS SHOW ME WHERE YOU ARE 
BEHOLD THE GREAT DEVIDE 
BETWEEN THE EARTH AND SKY 
TIMELESS SOULPRINTS ROAMING FOR A WHILE 
THEY NEVER SEEM TO FEAR 
THE EXECUTIONER IS HERE 
TO BLOW THEIR HEADS OFF 
HE IS FEEDING ON OUR TEARS 
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE 
TO COME WITH ME AND LOSE 
BUT YOU CAN ALSO STAY 
AND LET THE OTHERS SHOW THE WAY 
LET'S WALK TOWARD THE GATE 
BEFORE IT GETS TOO LATE 
PLEASE DON'T LOSE ME 
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME WAIT 
THIS CITY'S TAKING LIVES 
AND I WAS HOPING TO SURVIVE 
BUT WHO WILL STAND TO GUARD 
A PAIR OF ANCIENT SECRET CARDS 
YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE TODAY 
OR I'LL BE GOING ON MY WAY 
ABOVE ME JUST A STAR 
TO ALWAYS SHOW ME 
WHERE YOU ARE
