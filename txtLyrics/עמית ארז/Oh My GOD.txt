I'll sit in a train when the night is on 
look through the window 
straight at everyone 
and I'll know when they feel fine 
or just trying to keep their mind 
thinking "oh my god, what is that all about" 
I'll borrow a smile from a guy uptown 
I'll borrow a secret kept from everyone 
and there's a girl who sits and writes 
you can tell that she's so uptight 
thinking "oh my god, what is that all about" 
and the one at the side, 
he's an older man 
rolling a smoke with his tobacco hands 
probably thinking of his wife 
blaming her for messing up his life 
thinking "oh my god, I just could do without" 
little kid sitting right outside 
staring at me, that's always how he hides 
and he knows the 'whens' and 'whys' 
and he never wants to say goodbye 
saying "I'm your god, you don't need anyone"
