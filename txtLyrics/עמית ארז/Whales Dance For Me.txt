ONE DREAM TO BURY 
ONE NIGHT TO BEAR 
ONE FEAR TO CARRY 
ONE TIME TO CARE 
TO CARE 
STORMED BY THE SOLDIERS 
I RAN TO THE SEA 
NOW THAT Iâ€™M UNDER 
I LONG TO BE MASTER OF THE OCEAN 
WHILE THE WHALES DANCE FOR ME 
AND THE WHALES DANCE FOR ME 
ALL THAT IS SACRED 
COMES IN REVERSE 
WHAT MADE ME HAPPY 
UNVEILED A CURSE 
WAVES PARTED OPEN 
SAND TURNED TO LEAVES 
OVER THE MOUNTAIN 
I SPOTTED EVE DRINKING 
FROM THE FOUNTAIN 
I FORGOT HOW TO BREATH 
I FORGOT HOW TO BREATH
