My befallen afterlife
we can only dance together in the street
dance me to the other side
all we're seeing is a lie
all we think is better tends to be the same
when we fall into the light
won't you take me in the safe asylum of your hands?
lead me from the pavement to the waterside
cause everything they teach you
oh, it leaves you dry
My befallen afterlife
this should be the one desire left to keep
when we fall into the light
how do we relive together dancing cheek to cheek
lead me from the pavement to the waterside
cause everything they teach you
oh, it leaves you dry
and even if they hold you through the night..
(dance me to the other side...
My befallen afterlife...)
and the ballroom floor is thin
and the earth is shattering
and I lost my calling
under my befallen afterlife
my befallen
my befallen afterlife
my befallen
