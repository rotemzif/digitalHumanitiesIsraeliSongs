I saw you as an indian 
when I was a girl 
we talked about the summertime 
we gave each other winter rhymes 
and you just couldnt care enough 
and I just couldnt care less 
you know it's wrong but it's all right 
cuz now I know you sleep at night 
racing to the yard 
racing to the bed 
how could I forget the good? 
you know it's really wrong but it's all right.. 
cause now I know you sleep at night 
"you kill me with the way you smile" 
the plastic Jesus cried 
Maria landed on your head 
we're heading for the masquerade 
we're heading for the masquerade 
racing to the yard...
