when they saw you in the evening sunno one thought that you could be someone 
but you belong 
to those who won the game 
just the day to watch my sister goes 
just the day to watch this dream explodes 
you must be real 
you must be real 
to me 
now, looking at the sky 
the morning moon keeps you safe 
inside the raging sea 
and you had it all 
yes you had it all 
before me 
before me
