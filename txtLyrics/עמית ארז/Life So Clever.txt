Maybe you can let me understand your soul 
It's understandable 
It's picturing your beach with sharks all over 
And I'm coming just to save you 
Now I eat you whole 
I'm splashing here all over 
Down with palm trees packing whacking suitcase 
He made me come this far 
I want to be alone now, but you haunt me 
And do I have a choice? 
Destroying all the buildings down, 
After such a long time... 
My god you scare me 
You scare me almost like the way I scare myself 
All through the game... 
Don't get involved, don't get in 
It ain't wise to be myself, it ain't 
I can't cry, I can't cry 
It ain't no way to live your life 
It ain't no way to live 
Don't get involved, don't get in 
It ain't wise to be myself, it ain't 
I can't cry, I can't cry 
It ain't no way to live your life 
It ain't no way to live 
Maybe we can go and get ourselves a drink? 
I can't believe me. 
Down the drain again 
Oh life so clever 
Life so clever 
I'm splashing here all over
