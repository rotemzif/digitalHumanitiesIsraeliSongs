So we live in a bus stop 
A crossroad next to our love 
I think I know what i'm after 
But I'm not sure if it matters 
Used to say my heart away 
And ruin a beautiful night 
Caused a crying instead of lying 
Changing my mind all the time 
Might be wrong to believe me 
That everyone feels the same way 
Blowing smoke while they're leaving 
Their memories in the ashtray 
Wrap their pain in cellophane 
So no one will know it's around 
Never saw you as one of them 
except for a couple of times 
Used to say my heart away 
And ruin a beautiful night 
Caused a crying instead of lying 
Changing my mind all the time
