I bet that you can feel it 
now that you kill it 
flowers are dying somewhere inside 
now that you’re running 
now that you’re hiding 
keeping behind and swallowing pride 
I wrote and mailed her 
being a failure doesn’t mean you run a different life 
you can hear her heart going on 
keeping rhythm over the phone 
was there anything going wrong? 
and every time I wake up 
smearing the make up 
lifting the fake up 
waving goodbye 
I get a feeling during the killing 
flowers are dying somewhere inside 
and it’s a system programmed by wisdom 
you are far away but I’m inside 
you can hear our hearts going on... 
I’m going by the sideways 
taking the highways 
riding my bike 
I’m a Netherlands guy 
but in the evening I get a feeling 
I’m going down, I’m not getting high 
I’m not as peaceful as I am wishful 
you can never have too much in your life 
doesn’t matter what’s going on 
full is empty when you’re alone 
was there anything going wrong
