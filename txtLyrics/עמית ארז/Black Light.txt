Your sworn enemy 
Is coming for you 
The symphony sound 
Of epiphany tunes 
You better know what's 
Best for you 
Some sort of a clown 
Is urging me on 
To push myself down 
For his silly songs 
Here on the side, lying 
Giving birth 
To a chain of accidents 
It's the only true romance 
I'm driving alone 
Hungry as hell 
But leaving the last bite 
For somebody else 
Who's not as good 
As what he gets 
It's a chain of accidents 
I'm a waste of elements 
it's a chain of accidents 
i'm a waste of elements 
I live in a black light
