they say she's coming back again 
falling from the sky 
with her yellow distorted air 
and her freedom eyes 
running out for to see her hands 
gathering their souls 
I dont care about them anyway 
I dont wanna go 
I'll stay in my room all day long 
listening to Pink Floyd sing of an eiderdown 
what it means I dont know... 
watch them go 
again 
pretty lady of circumstances 
come on home 
lights wont follow you anywhere 
now your song is old 
arent you tired of living this way ? 
taking your clothes off 
waring them back again ... 
dont you want to exchange you ways 
for something else ? 
so change
