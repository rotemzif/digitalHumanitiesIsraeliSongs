full indication of life on a leaf 
tell me what you feel when you fall asleep 
water and circles and silent TV 
grab whatever you need 
what you wanna be, 
clever and strong 
pass along singing your love song 
I've seen you undressed 
I could feel pressures upon your chest 
plastic emotion I meant to forget 
fell right out of my head 
guess I haven't learned 
morning has come in a shape of a tree 
sat so comfortably 
oh so hard to be, 
clever and strong 
pass along singing you love song 
I've seen you undressed 
I could feel pressures upon your chest
