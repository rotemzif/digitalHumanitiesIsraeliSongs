THE DAY’S AWAKE AT LEAST AN HOUR EVERY NIGHT 
IT TAKES MY HAND AND TWISTS MY ARM 
A SIMPLE SOLID TRUTH THAT PAVES ITS WAY TO HARM 
SENDS THE DAYLIGHT THROUGH MY PALM 
IT MAY APPEAR TO YOU THAT EVERYTHING IS BROKEN 
BUT IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN APART 
AND EACH DISASTROUS RECOLLECTION OF THE PAST 
SENDS THE DAYLIGHT THROUGH YOUR HEART 
LAST NIGHT WHEN I TRIED TO SLEEP 
I FELT WITH MY FINGERTIPS… 
…THE OCEAN 
IT TAKES SO FUCKING LONG FOR ANYTHING TO HAPPEN 
I COULD HAVE DIED AND STARTED OVER AGAIN 
THE CHOKING THROAT SEEMS TO ENJOY THE WAY YOU STRANGLE 
AS THE COLORS FADE AWAY 
YOU DON’T APPRECIATE THE THINGS THAT YOU’VE BEEN GIVEN 
YOU FIND IT HARD TO STAY AWAKE 
AT LEAST THE NIGHT IS DARK AND SO WE ARE FORGIVEN 
FOR THE ERRORS THAT WE MAKE 
LAST NIGHT WHEN I TRIED TO SLEEP 
I FELT WITH MY FINGERTIPS… 
…THE OCEAN 
IT’S NEVER EVEN CLOSE TO WHAT YOU REALLY WANTED
