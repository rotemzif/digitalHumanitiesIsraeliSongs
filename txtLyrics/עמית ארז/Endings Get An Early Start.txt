I'm over everybody 
And I'm over everything 
I'm hung on a pin 
Empty of opinions like a painting 
On a wall waiting for days 
Thinking of ways to fill 
How you seen to fail your heart 
Endings get an early start 
Oh you're going nowhere 
You're a failure of a song 
You're doing it wrong 
I would be a baby 
I would be a little boy 
Wasted in bed 
Trading her hands for toys 
Always be the one who knows 
No one follows where you go 
I'll go insane tomorrow 
I'll go insane tomorrow 
I'll go insane tomorrow 
Now we can observe the 
Evolutions' other end 
The mighty descend 
Nothing really gives me any 
Pleasure anymore 
All that I know, 
All that I'm waiting for 
How you seem to fail your heart 
Endings get an early start
