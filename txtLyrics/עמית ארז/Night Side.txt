I'll wait on the night side 
no one tells me where I should go 
I'll wait on the night side 
I'm awake and nobody knows 
I'll wait for the night ride 
there's a party at the edge of town 
and everyone is going down 
to the prettiest place 
where the glitter and lace are on 
I will go there another day, another day 
to make my way 
see the painting on the wall 
press a button and I'll make it fall 
when it shatters to tears 
of the previous years alone 
goes the frame, 
oh it's such a shame, it's such a shame 
but who can blame her after all 
with the skeletons of happy clowns 
and smaller girls with bigger sons 
I'm a little intrigued by the people I chase around 
through the town, 
they will crush you when you make a sound 
you make a sound 
is it over when the light comes in 
when everything begins to spin 
and the memories show that the people they go away 
far away 
do you say the words you want to say to make them stay?
