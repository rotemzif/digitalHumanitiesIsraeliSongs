I'm dying just like everyone else 
resting at ease 
no one comes near 
light years from my bed 
just like everyone says 
it used to be a part of the deal 
don't be yourself 
always conceal 
don't feel 
just pretend 
just like everyone can 
you won't get me now 
you won't get me now 
it's harder when my meaning have no words 
might as well give numbers to explain my life 
to everyone who thinks I'm odd 
nothing's gonna matter when the bombs will fall 
upon us all 
and they will fall 
nothing's gonna make me crawl
