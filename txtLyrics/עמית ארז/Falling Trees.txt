dark summer 
falling trees 
dreams hover on ocean breeze 
we smiled at times 
tending to wonder 
and then we sighed and said goodbye 
and sobered 
my mornings are estranged 
my future is around the bend 
and days go by, facing this hunger 
they always try but I deny 
and slumber 
feel the wind 
it spins you around 
take it in and stay on the ground 
the coast is clear behind this fear 
I never watched it at all 
long hours deep within 
the anchor is sinking in 
it holds me down, underachieving 
and all this time it questions my believing 
see the jester taking the crown 
I can try and turn it around 
the falling trees and ocean breeze 
we never left them at all
