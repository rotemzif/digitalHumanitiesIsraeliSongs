I'm going to make the same mistake 
same thing I did just yesterday 
I know I'm running out of time 
this is the wrong place for my kind 
say what you want to, 
I don't care what you're thinking 
send me a postcard 
I don't care what you're writing 
always been talking about making dreams come true 
I won't be there to take it away from you 
nobody wanted you to go 
even your daddy told me so 
but you're so eager in your way 
I change the subject every day 
say what you want to...
