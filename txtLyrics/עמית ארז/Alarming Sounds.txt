You wanna know something 
I'd rather turn around 
Float like a silhouette sun 
Especially under 
Your brightest wedding gown 
Guess we should find you one 
Listen to this town 
These alarming sounds 
Emotional labor 
Of putting up a fight 
Clutches my thoughts at night 
Incredibly slandered 
By someone that I love 
My heart is leaking blood 
Listen how it pounds 
This is alarming sound 
Born a treasure in a tank of gold 
We suffer greatness with pain 
Like a coral in a mourning robe 
A summer conquered by rain 
I'll disappear quickly 
And leave it all behind 
Find my own place and time 
When no one is listening 
There's no need to be loud 
You're much better of a crowd 
Listen to this town 
These alarming sounds 
Born a treasure in a tank of gold...
