I can't even say it loud enough
The motion is real and terrible
aside of the broken promises
there's a window of light and glow
why do you scare off animals
to the horizon, Emily?
and do you define your innocence
as a picture of fiery gold?
whenever the sun comes to rape me
whenever the sun comes
I'll have a quiet holiday
making assumptions endlessly
she wants to practice medicine
on the people who die the most
if I had to venture anyplace
never to see you anymore
would you allow me to retain
all the passion I've had for you before?
whenever the sun came to rape me
whenever the sun came
