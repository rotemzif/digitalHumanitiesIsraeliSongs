I see two suns 
That's what you say... 
Here's a thought you 
Should keep with 
All you believe 
Wake up children 
Get out of bed 
Now the morning is stronger 
Night won't take over again 
And we're gonna win 
And the streets will 
Carry our names 
Don't delay, tell all your friends 
Now your picture's finnaly given 
A frame 
I'm so let down 
I'm so depressed 
I can see my intentions 
Going the wrong way again 
No chance to shine, 
Only to stare 
All that light never finds me 
Two suns that don't even care 
And we're gonna win 
And the streets will 
Carry our names 
Don't delay, tell all your friends 
You can leave me here 
I'll be claping my hands
