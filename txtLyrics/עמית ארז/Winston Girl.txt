I wanna love my winston girl 
the crimson tide will bring my pearl to shore 
pearls are hard to find 
don’t you know 
my love grows for unreal girls 
and she will smile when we get high 
and she will curse and make me cry 
she’ll be painting songs 
those I’ll write late at night 
after we made love 
how I wanna meet you now 
how I’d love to meet you now
