I don't know what happened to all the faces I've grown 
cinnamon's scattered along your shoulders 
someone else is going to break your phone 
someone else is going to break your home 
and I had no illusions you tried to watch me before 
over the rainbow, above the monsters 
try to live your life for better days 
try to live your life for better days 
must I go through the change? 
can't take off the stains 
in your life you never stop, 
you re-arrange 
by the sight of your land 
all the flowers must bend 
I can smile if you give me your name 
striving to be happy I wanna touch you again 
wanna escape the nights of wonder 
digging deeper holes for me to jump in 
digging deeper holes for me to feel 
sparkling at the bus-stop 
and on the bus you were dead 
you were exposed, you morning angel 
I shall catch you down and set you free 
I shall catch you down and set you free 
trust your life in my hands 
all the flowers must bend 
can I hide in your smile? 
can I pretend? 
can I have you for now? 
can I have you forever? 
can I die? 
can I die on your land
