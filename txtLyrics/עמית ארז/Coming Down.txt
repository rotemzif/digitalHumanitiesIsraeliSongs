PICKING UP THE PHONE 
TO FIND HOW YOU GET ALONG 
YOU’RE ALL BETTER NOW 
AND SOON THEY’LL TAKE YOU HOME 
EVERYTHING YOU SAID 
CREATES TERROR IN MY HEAD 
I NEVER LIED 
I JUST MADE YOU MAD 
YOU WILL RISE 
BUT I WILL BE LYING HERE 
YOU WILL FIND 
THAT I NEVER DISAPPEAR 
COMING DOWN WAS ALWAYS 
MY BIGGEST FEAR 
COMING DOWN 
LESSON NUMBER ONE 
WAS HOW NOT TO LET YOU DOWN 
LOVE AS A PRIZE HAS NO SPARK AT ALL 
LESSON NUMBER FOUR 
WAS UNLOCKING ALL THE DOORS 
LONG LULLABIES FALLING TO THE FLOOR 
YOU WILL RISE 
BUT I WILL BE LYING HERE 
YOU WILL FIND 
THAT I NEVER DISAPPEAR 
COMING DOWN WAS ALWAYS 
MY BIGGEST FEAR 
COMING DOWN
