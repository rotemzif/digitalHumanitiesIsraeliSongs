PRETTY THINGS 
PRETTY THINGS 
DON’T BE AFRAID OF THE RAIN 
OF THE RAIN 
HOLY THINGS 
HOLY THINGS 
DON’T WE ALL FEEL JUST THE SAME 
JUST THE SAME 
CLOUDED IN WHITE 
WE SHINE IN THE NIGHT 
AND ALL EARTHLY THEMES 
ARE BELOW US 
COME AND SING 
EARTHLY THINGS 
WE’RE JUST AS WORTHY 
OF ALL PRAISES HIGH 
I’LL BEGIN ANYTHING 
WITH A REMAIN OF A SMILE IN MY EYE 
GLOWING IN WHITE 
IT SHINES IN THE NIGHT 
WAITING TO FIND YOU IN SHADOWS
