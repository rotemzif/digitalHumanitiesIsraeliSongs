parked by your eyes 
hating your every move 
feeling your hands, tasting your food 
can you believe that I’m not in the mood? 
you’re so crazy and weak 
and you’re a stranger to me 
and it’s true what they say about highways 
can you recall the pavements on holidays? 
trying to be a part of your home.. 
when somehow you end up feeling alone 
and your story begins with a tear on the chin 
and it’s true what they say about new ways
