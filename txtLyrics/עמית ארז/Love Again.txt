IT'S WEARING ME OUT 
JUST LIKE A CLOUD OVER MY HEAD 
AND CLOUDS AREN'T KNOWN 
FOR TRAVELING ALONE 
NOR TO BE NEEDED 
AND IN SOME DAYS 
WHEN THEY BLOCK THE SUN 
I GET A STRANGE DESIRE 
LEAVING EVERYONE 
SLEEP THOUGH I'M BARELY TIRED 
AND PEOPLE COME BY 
THEY CALL ME A LIAR 
YOU WILL LOVE AGAIN 
JUST AS THE SUMMER IS KICKING IN 
IN TOTAL RUSH YOU FAIL TO SEE 
ANYTHING'S BETTER THAN MEMORIES 
YOUR LIFE GETS CRUSHED 
I'M SORRY TO SAY 
I DON'T WANNA PLAY ANY LONGER 
IT'S PUTTING ME ON 
THAT SOMETHING MIGHT GROW 
HIGHER AND STRONGER 
BUT THE TRUTH IS EVERYTHING'S THE SAME 
JUST AS IT WAS BEFORE 
PEOPLE CALL YOU NAMES 
I NEVER KEEP THE SCORE 
SOME SAY YOU'RE FAKE 
AND OTHERS ADORE 
YOU WILL LOVE AGAIN...
