we're on the boat 
in the 19th century 
we're having trouble 
to connect us with the sea 
I spent all night just to prepare the most 
I spent all morning tying all the ropes 
we're in a car 
in the 20th century 
we're out of gas 
and there's no onw here to see 
I dont mind staying here all night long 
I dont mind walking all the way back home 
we're on a spaceship 
in the 30th century 
we're lost inside the outside 
leaving us to be 
I dont mind that you're the only one with me
