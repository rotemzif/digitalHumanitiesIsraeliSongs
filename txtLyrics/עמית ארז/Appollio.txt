oh my sweet appollio 
I'm tied to your heart 
and I wonder if you feel that shivering too, my love 
I will never let you go 
we breathe side by side 
on the bed of our wedding eternity's ours to hide 
see the town is glowing 
see the people gathered all around us 
see how we shine 
I had a morning tonight 
and if I only had a second then I'd know 
that it's a lifetime 
that drifted behind 
willing and able to cry 
oh my sweet appollio 
I promise you now 
that the world that you keep will be 
nothing but stones and ground 
so when the future comes to pass 
and horns they will sound 
you will know by the siren 
the meeting is soon to come
