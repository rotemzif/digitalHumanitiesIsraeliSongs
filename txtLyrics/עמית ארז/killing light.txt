I'll be following every step
you know this town in small enough
and we could meet by chance and gaze upon 
the sidewalks that wouldn't open up for us
and I'm likely to spend my days
waiting in the house alone
my medicine in hand, I'll make up a lie
to make sure that I am comfortable apart
killing light could never seem to fix me,
but I've had enough to try my best to defy it
hand in hand, the never-ending story of your meaningless goodbyes
resolved in a worry, a candle in your eyes
simplicity at best is waiting for an entourage
it's only common sense to pick up a fight
she's a belly dancer swimming in the flood
and it's a hell of a lot to say,
I'm seeing through the camouflage,
and we should know by now how to survive
we're killing some, before we open up
killing light could never seem to fix me,
but I've had enough to try my best to defy it
hand in hand, the never-ending story of your meaningless goodbyes
resolved in a worry
