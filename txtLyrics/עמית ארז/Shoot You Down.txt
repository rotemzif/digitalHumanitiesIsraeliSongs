Time by your heart 
Wish I could make it a story 
How you saved me for heaven 
And threw me down again 
Cold by your side 
Holding my breath and dreaming 
We share the same distance 
From the ground to the water streams 
I cannot see 
What I can be 
How you rise like a bird, with liquid delight 
I wanna shoot you down.. 
Look at me now, 
Holding my aching feelings 
You'll make it a story 
And I can listen well 
But you cannot see 
What I can be 
Oh, just hearing your voice, 
I long to be deaf 
I wanna shoot you down
