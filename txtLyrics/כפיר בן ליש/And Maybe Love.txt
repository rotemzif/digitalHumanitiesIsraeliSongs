Don’t speak of the day 
Don’t mention the night 
We’d stumble and fall 
Feel nothing at all 
Maybe your fault maybe mine 
We would worry all the time 
And maybe love stands in our way 
And maybe love leads us astray 
And maybe love has its own way 
And maybe love took you away - from us 
We think we are strong 
Feel right, when were wrong 
Beyond each chasm, behind each wall 
You’ll find nothing at all 
Maybe your fault maybe mine 
We would worry all the time 
And maybe love…
