Rosalinda 
Treasure in a girl 
Next to her the world 
Seems empty of love 
Your one cut above 
Rosalinda 
You and I both know 
What it is we show 
When all that is ours 
Withers like flowers 
Rosalinda 
You can see her 
Wastes no time, Wastes no money 
When the thing she really wants 
Is the only one. 
Rosalinda 
You can please her 
Daises on a sunny April dawn 
But the things she really wants 
Crumble in the sun, She’s the only one 
You and I both know 
Where it is we go 
Though dreams never came 
They whispered the name 
Rosalinda 
Teardrops in her eyes 
Smiling as she cries 
I loved you in vain 
I’II love you the same 
Rosalinda 
Through her window 
Gathers in the misty morning haze 
And the thing she really wants 
Is the only one. 
Rosalinda 
You can please her 
Daises on a sunny April dawn 
Though the things she really wants 
Crumble in the sun, She’s the only one 
Teardrops in her eyes 
Smiling as she cries 
I loved you in vain 
I’II love you the same 
Rosalinda
