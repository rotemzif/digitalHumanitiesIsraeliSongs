I need 
eyes to look at 
Just for a little while 
I need 
words to listen to 
Just for a little while 
I need someone alive 
Just to be with 
Just for a little while 
I'm loosing now, loosing now 
It's hard to keep believing in good will and smiles, they 
all seem untrue 
I'm going to sleep now 
Won't you please wake me up when loneliness is through
