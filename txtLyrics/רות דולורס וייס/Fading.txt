Who will see you fading 
Loosing conscience and color 
Loosing conscience in the spider web of despair 
after crying time is always dazzling in it's pureness 
The temptation of going all the way 
The temptation of going all the way 
The temptation of going all the way 
Invisible 
Powerless 
Unable to reach hand and touch the living
