No turning back time 
movement is constant 
No turning back time 
movement is constant 
No turning back time 
movement is constant 
No two skies above alike 
And the road is always changing 
Everything is changing 
Change is in us 
Everything is moving 
Movement is in us 
Your light, your light, my love 
Moves with me 
And your love, your love, my light 
Lights the changing rode for me
