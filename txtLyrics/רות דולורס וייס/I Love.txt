I love this blue life of mine 
Love it, won't change it for nothing 
I love this blue life of mine 
With all the troubles I had, and there's more to come 
It may be easier for some 
Some may be happier 
But no one's life ca be more beautiful then mine 
My beautiful blue life 
No one's dreams can be more real then mine 
I lived of dreaming for so long 
No one's hope can be stronger then mine 
It survived where no hope can grow 
It may be easier for some 
Some may be happier 
And it's true, some times there's no one to see 
this beauty but me 
So I sing, so I sing to myself 
I love this blue life of mine 
Love it, won't change it for nothing 
I love this blue life of mine 
With all the troubles I had, and there's more to come 
It may be easier for some 
Some may be happier 
But no one's life ca be more beautiful then mine 
My beautiful blue life
