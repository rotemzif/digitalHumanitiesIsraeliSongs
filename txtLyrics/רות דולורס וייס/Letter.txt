I got a dog and she sings sometimes 
Got a man who loves me more then life 
Got bourbon in glass, my piano is with me 
I can see the sea every day 
I love this life though it scares me more then Death 
Well, nothing came easy 
And I gave up a lot 
but I never stopped being what I wanted to be and I'm proud, 
And I'm strong 
And when she says that my life is head of me 
I pray to god she's not wrong 
I don't pray to god for anything else, I can handle it all 
I'm ready for disappointments as long as I give it all 
I don't pray to god for anything else but I wish upon stars 
And I try to believe in luck 
And I'm drinking for you every time that I drink and I try to believe in luck 
I try to believe in luck 
I try to believe in luck 
I try to believe in luck 
and I don't want to die without meeting you
