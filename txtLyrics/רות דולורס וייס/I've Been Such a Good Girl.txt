I've been such a good girl 
I've been such a good girl 
Why do you look at me this way 
Why do you look so distant 
Did all what you told me 
Followed all instructions 
Guess it didn't work 
I didn't turn to solid gold 
But I wanted to so bad 
First it wasn't easy 
Something inside me struggled so hard 
First it wasn't easy 
But drop by drop it dropped 
To be a better person, to live a better life 
To be more easy, to be one of your kind 
To be less dreamy, abusive, depressing, illusive 
So you could see my love 
And I wanted to so bad 
And I wanted to so bad 
And I wanted to so bad 
But I lost my heart instead
