It gets me anyway, it gets me anyway 
No matter what I do, no matter what I pray 
It gets me anyway 
It gets me anyway 
That awful blues 
I don't feel upset 
I know each has his share 
and everyone is free 
It's just that some choose to live in jail 
I don't feel upset but I'm weakening 
Help me if you can 
It gets me anyway 
It gets me anyway 
have I lost the fight 
It feels as if it's hear to stay and it gets me 
Anyway 
That awful blues
