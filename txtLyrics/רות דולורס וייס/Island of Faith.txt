I want to show you a way 
Show you a way to an island of faith 
Island of faith where your home is 
Where you can plant your seeds of happiness 
And watch them grow 
And the skies are yours to choose from 
And the skies are yours to choose from 
Island of faith, island of faith 
Where you can live in peace with your thoughts 
Where you can dance with the wind and be what you want to be 
And run free 
Island of faith, island of faith 
Island of faith 
I want to show you a way 
to and island of faith 
Like someone once showed me with hard full of love 
I want to show you a way to an island of faith 
inside you
