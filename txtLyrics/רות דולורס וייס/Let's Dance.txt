It's winter now, and the nights are cold 
And we try to keep each other warm 
But last night you looked though me 
I fall in love with you 
Every day 
From the start 
Big, yellow moon is lighting our world tonight 
And I walk, but I can't swallow my tears any more 
And I know 
You're fool as me 
And we both have fears and anger 
And it's hard, to escape from this madness 
and it's hard to forget all this troubles 
But tonight 
Just this one time dance with me 
Let me put my head on your shoulder 
Close your eyes, close your eye and dance with me 
And forget 
Forget everything but me 
And now 
That the whole world disappeared 
Lets dance
