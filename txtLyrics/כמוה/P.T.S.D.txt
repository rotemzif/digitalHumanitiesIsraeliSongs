Hold me in your eyes
Look at me and hold me
Don't you let me slip away
You know how bad I want to stay
But I don't know how
Hold me in your lips
Talk to me and hold me
Don't let silence wash away
All the many things I want to say
But I don't know how
I was trying to hold on to a beautiful moment
When all clocks around me lost track of their minds and sailed away
And I could see your smile melt into your skin and fade away
Hold me in your sleep
Dream of me and hold me
Don't let songbirds spread their lies
I should have known by now they'll only sing till the sun goes down
And when night falls
And thunder rolls
I look for rainbows in the dark
Glowing
Showing a way for me to follow back
But I don't now how
I was trying to hold on to a beautiful moment
When all clocks around me lost track of their minds and sailed away
I could see your eyes closing for my next demise
Just when I thought I caught a glimpse of the smell of your hair
The sirens went off screaming and nothing else came through
And I didn't care to die
I just needed you to hear them too
A thousand horses ride me under
A thousand horses drive me under
A thousand horses tie me under
Thousand horses drag me underground
