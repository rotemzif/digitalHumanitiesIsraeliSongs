I've read today something in the paper 
a child was born in a middle of a war 
and it's really hard to understand 
He made it through it all, 
and that's a miracle. 
I see the birds fly around the mountains 
heading south right before the fall 
and its really hard to understand 
they know just where to go 
and that's a miracle 
And then there's you 
looking right at me 
and then there is you 
beautiful and free 
and there is la la la love 
...And that's a miracle 
It is strange, cause we are only human 
you know, a man has been walking on the moon 
and its really hard to understand 
I thought I've seen it all 
But that's a miracle 
And then there's you... 
Some People say that I (could) never fly 
and they will tell me it's useless to try 
I know that I will never walk the moon 
Yes; it's true, I guess it's you. 
And then there's you… 
…And that's a miracle
