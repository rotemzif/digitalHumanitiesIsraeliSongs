Stronger
I feel I’m finally stronger
And now the madness is over
I think I'm able to fly
Sober
I keep my dreams even higher
And nearly like a survivor
I'll never break down and cry
I've held onto the sky
I've never questioned why
As long as I can try
Won't let my spirit die
I'm in love
And I am ready to shine
It's time to close that door
Don't need you anymore
All that I'm wishing for
The light that I adore
Is mine
And I am ready to shine
Nowhere
Just a place to discover
Not to remain undercover
There’s so much more left to live
Said I’m Stronger
I feel I’m finally stronger
And now the madness is over
I’m think I’m able to fly
I've held onto the sky
I've never questioned why
As long as I can try
Won't let my spirit die
I'm in love
And I am ready to shine
It's time to close that door
Don't need you anymore
All that I'm wishing for
The light that I adore
Is mine
And I am ready to shine
