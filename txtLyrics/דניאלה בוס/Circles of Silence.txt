Circles of silence
Bring you close to yourself
When you get closer
Enter the change
Let it into your soul
Why do you fear you'll lose control?
So, everythingâ€™s coming back again
But slightly different
Not exactly the same.
Circles of silence
Diving into your heart
They gently open the rancid door
Of the horror warehouse
Where all we had swallowed is stored.
Why do you fear you'll lose control?
So, if you give up half of your old guilt
You're slightly different
Not exactly the same
And so, everything's coming back again
But slightly different
Not exactly the same
