Chilling out I'm lying down on this wet sand
My legs refuse to take me anywhere else
Feeling calm my lips are salty and my mind is clear
All I've ever wanted in life is right here
And the waves are coming right at me
And the waves are coming to take me
Closing my eyes another year is passing by
Still lying down on this wet sand
My legs refuse to take me anywhere else
And the waves are coming right at me
And the waves are coming to take me
Chilling out
The war is over
You can now come out 'cos the war is over
