          <l>Hold me in your eyes</l>
          <l>Look at me and hold me</l>
          <l>Don't you let me slip away</l>
          <l>You know how bad I want to stay</l>
          <l>But I don't know how</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>Hold me in your lips</l>
          <l>Talk to me and hold me</l>
          <l>Don't let silence wash away</l>
          <l>All the many things I want to say</l>
          <l>But I don't know how</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>I was trying to hold on to a beautiful moment</l>
          <l>When all clocks around me lost track of their minds and sailed away</l>
          <l>And I could see your smile melt into your skin and fade away</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>Hold me in your sleep</l>
          <l>Dream of me and hold me</l>
          <l>Don't let songbirds spread their lies</l>
          <l>I should have known by now they'll only sing till the sun goes down</l>
          <l>And when night falls</l>
          <l>And thunder rolls</l>
          <l>I look for rainbows in the dark</l>
          <l>Glowing</l>
          <l>Showing a way for me to follow back</l>
          <l>But I don't now how</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>I was trying to hold on to a beautiful moment</l>
          <l>When all clocks around me lost track of their minds and sailed away</l>
          <l>I could see your eyes closing for my next demise</l>
          <l>Just when I thought I caught a glimpse of the smell of your hair</l>
          <l>The sirens went off screaming and nothing else came through</l>
          <l>And I didn't care to die</l>
          <l>I just needed you to hear them too</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="6" type="stanza">
          <l>A thousand horses ride me under</l>
          <l>A thousand horses drive me under</l>
          <l>A thousand horses tie me under</l>
          <l>Thousand horses drag me underground</l>
