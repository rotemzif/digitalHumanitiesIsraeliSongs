        <head>Indian Queen</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>I think often of you, I hope you're feeling better. </l>
          <l>It's been hard for me, getting it together. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>We live in different rooms. You said yours is getting smaller. I bet you're lying there with all your typical anger. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>But wonderful things will come your way. Flowers like you've dreamed , will grow in your hair. And your bitter tears will have honey flowing in between. You'll stay like we played. My indian queen. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>It's so quiet now, and I'm remembering your crazy talking. You wanted to take the last train, just because you had no idea where it was going. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>Now we live in different rooms. You said yours is getting smaller. I bet you're lying there, waiting for the final closure. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="6" type="stanza">
          <l>But wonderful things will come your way. Flowers like you've dreamed , will grow in your hair. And your bitter tears will have honey flowing in between. You'll stay like we played. My indian queen</l>
