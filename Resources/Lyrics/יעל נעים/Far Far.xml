          <l>Far far, there's this little girl </l>
          <l>she was praying for something to happen to her </l>
          <l>everyday she writes words and more words </l>
          <l>just to speak out the thoughts that keep floating inside </l>
          <l>and she's strong when the dreams come cos' they </l>
          <l>take her, cover her, they are all over </l>
          <l>the reality looks far now, but don't go </l>
        </lg>

          <l>How can you stay outside? </l>
          <l>there's a beautiful mess inside </l>
          <l>how can you stay outside? </l>
          <l>there's a beautiful mess inside </l>
          <l>oh oh oh oh </l>

          <l>Far far, there's this little girl </l>
          <l>she was praying for something good to happen to her </l>
          <l>from time to time there're colors and shapes </l>
          <l>dazeling her eyes, tickeling her hands </l>
          <l>they invent her a new world with </l>
          <l>oil skies and aquarel rivers </l>
          <l>but don't you run away already </l>
          <l>please don't go oh oh </l>

          <l>Far far there's this little girl </l>
          <l>she was praying for something big to happen to her </l>
          <l>every night she ears beautiful strange music </l>
          <l>it's everywhere there's nowhere to hide </l>
          <l>but if it fades she begs </l>
          <l>"oh lord don't take it from me, don't take it yourselves" </l>
