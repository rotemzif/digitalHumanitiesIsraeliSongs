        <head>In love with you</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>I remember when we met, </l>
          <l>You were almost twenty-one, </l>
          <l>On your head a yellow hat, and your sweet face was red, </l>
          <l>From too much sun. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>Wonder where are you right now </l>
          <l>Are you somewhere helping injured birds to fly, </l>
          <l>What has happened in your life, are you still in love </l>
          <l>With the other guy? </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>Then I met you once again </l>
          <l>You were almost twenty-four, </l>
          <l>Many things were on your mind; you had to catch a train, just like before. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>Time is moving by so fast </l>
          <l>Could you ever find a little time to stay? </l>
          <l>What’s the point in this life if you can never rest? </l>
          <l>A few hours in a day. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>Seasons passing like the wind </l>
          <l>I’ve been longing for your touch </l>
          <l>You were once in love with me, and me with you, </l>
          <l>I know this much. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="6" type="stanza">
          <l>Now together in a home </l>
          <l>You’ve been my forever mate, </l>
          <l>I’m so glad for never giving up on you </l>
          <l>You are so beautiful, </l>
          <l>Almost eighty-eight.</l>
