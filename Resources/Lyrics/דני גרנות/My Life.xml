        <head>My Life</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>I never cared when people said what I should do with my life, </l>
          <l>I always did what felt just right, for my two kids and my wife. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>I’ve built a home </l>
          <l>Provided food </l>
          <l>Paid for their school </l>
          <l>Helped with their mood, </l>
          <l>I treated life as an art. </l>
          <l>I gave them my heart, </l>
          <l>There is nothing I regret until the day I depart. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>I never cared when people said to go do this or do that, </l>
          <l>I always heard my inner voice beyond the mind and its chat. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>I closed my eye </l>
          <l>Emptied the noise </l>
          <l>Breathed once or twice </l>
          <l>Dissolved without choice </l>
          <l>Until the silence appeared </l>
          <l>And my mind got so clear </l>
          <l>A state of bliss and love not even one drop of fear. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>I didn’t care when people laughed at my looks or my voice, </l>
          <l>Deep down inside I always new, that I did have a choice. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="6" type="stanza">
          <l>To be strong like a rock </l>
          <l>Or weak as a leaf </l>
          <l>To say what I had to </l>
          <l>No matter the grief, </l>
          <l>Then the world was mine. </l>
          <l>I was on cloud nine </l>
          <l>And everyone around me at once looked benign. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="7" type="stanza">
          <l>I live my life to the fullest now, on a mountaintop in Spain </l>
          <l>Cherish music food and sun, with Vivi and a Great Dane </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="8" type="stanza">
          <l>We read some good books </l>
          <l>Visit with friends </l>
          <l>Paint nature in oils </l>
          <l>Often laugh and dance </l>
          <l>A perfect life to be had, </l>
          <l>Not doing one thing we dread </l>
          <l>We could be in Detroit but we are in Spain instead. </l>
