        <head>After The Storm</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>So many heartaches &amp; a fallen star was missing on the way </l>
          <l>You thought you could own me, </l>
          <l>with just the right tune and a pretty thing to say </l>
          <l>Pushing me on and on, covered with sweat, the roads keep playing </l>
          <l>I couldn’t let go of you, and yet, I was saying: </l>
          <l>Sorry I hurt you, but sometimes you need </l>
          <l>to settle for the better hand and I </l>
          <l>had to unease you, don’t take it too hard, I had to be looking </l>
          <l>And there’s a wave that’s calling, playing me hard and loud </l>
          <l>Tossing me about, my heart keeps cracking, it keeps on breaking apart </l>
          <l>I see the rainbow, knocking at my window </l>
          <l>standing in the way of the dark </l>
          <l>playing hard to get with my heart </l>
          <l>Walking in miracles </l>
          <l>The arrows you poisoned were constantly missing my heart </l>
          <l>My River was flowing </l>
          <l>And yesterdays’ grace was heavily hid in the dark </l>
          <l>A barefoot girl is walking </l>
          <l>Soaking wet dress, mud painted face, and a trace </l>
          <l>of long love-drunk nights </l>
          <l>Holding wounded visions &amp; withered flowers in her hand </l>
          <l>After the dark storm comes the shattering calm </l>
          <l>Crispy bright light shines on </l>
          <l>it only cuts deeper in the sad eyes looking for home </l>
          <l>Everyone wears the skin that one bears, or else, trying to get by </l>
          <l>Cold bottled water, struggling accents and palaces cutting the sky</l>
