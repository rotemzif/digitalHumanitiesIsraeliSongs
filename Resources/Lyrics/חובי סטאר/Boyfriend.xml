        <head>Boyfriend</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>The girl is crazy</l>
          <l>,she jumps and makes a lot of noise</l>
          <l>Just like a record, she spins around with all the boys.</l>
          <l>The queen of drama, she's looking for a Special king.</l>
          <l>She She needs love(ho damn! )Its just another fling. </l>
          <l>Now what she did last night will not make him stay.</l>
          <l>She tries to make it right but makes it worse everyday. </l>
          <l>She needs a boyfriend, boyfriend.</l>
          <l>Who'll understand?</l>
          <l>Boyfriend, boyfriend. And not a one night stand.</l>
          <l>Boyfriend, boyfriend .she needs a man.</l>
          <l>She's looking for a boyfriend!</l>
          <l>The perfect hottie is standing right across the room.</l>
          <l>He getting closer and makes her heart go boom boom boom.</l>
          <l>He's all she wonted but there is just one little thing.</l>
          <l>On his hand "bling-bling" she missed his wedding ring.</l>
          <l>Now what she did last night will not make him stay</l>
          <l>She tries to make it right but makes it worse everyday.</l>
          <l>She needs a boyfriend, boyfriend.</l>
          <l>Who'll understand?</l>
          <l>boyfriend, boyfriend. And not a one night stand.</l>
          <l>boyfriend, boyfriend. She needs a man.</l>
          <l>She's looking for a boyfriend!</l>
          <l>They never dare for you, care for you</l>
          <l>they're never there for you</l>
          <l>just like a statue girl</l>
          <l>see how they stare at you</l>
          <l>she's looking for mister right, how could that be?</l>
          <l>when instead of a BF she's making out with an FB</l>
          <l>f.u.c.k. buddy - buddy</l>
          <l>on her body everybody spins</l>
          <l>in this crazy competition she never wins</l>
          <l>it's not her boyfriend, her toyfriend</l>
          <l>it's only her enjoy-friend</l>
          <l>so don't you ask me why you always try,</l>
          <l>but you never find a boyfriend </l>
          <l>You'll never find a boyfriend, these boys say you're the hot trend.</l>
          <l>But disappear and break your hart.</l>
          <l>You'll never find a boyfriend, there will be no happy end.</l>
          <l>You will go right back to the start</l>
          <l>She needs a boyfriend, boyfriend.</l>
          <l>Who'll understand?</l>
          <l>boyfriend, boyfriend. And not a one night stand.</l>
          <l>boyfriend, boyfriend. She needs a man.</l>
          <l>She's looking for a boyfriend!</l>
