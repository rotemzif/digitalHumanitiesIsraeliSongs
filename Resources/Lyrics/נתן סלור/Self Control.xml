        <head>Self Control</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>Oh, the night is my world, city light painted girl </l>
          <l>In the day nothing matters, it's the night time that flatters </l>
          <l>In the night, no control, through the wall something's breaking </l>
          <l>Wearing white as you're walkin' down the street of my soul </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>You take my self, you take my self control </l>
          <l>You got me livin' only for the night </l>
          <l>Before the morning comes, the story's told </l>
          <l>You take my self, you take my self control </l>
          <l>Another night, another day goes by </l>
          <l>I never stop myself to wonder why </l>
          <l>You make me to forget to play my role </l>
          <l>You take my self, you take my self control </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>I, I live among the creatures of the night </l>
          <l>I haven't got the will to try and fight </l>
          <l>Against a new tomorrow, so I guess I'll just believe it </l>
          <l>That tomorrow never comes </l>
          <l>A safe night, I'm living in the forest of my dream </l>
          <l>I know the night is not as it would seem </l>
          <l>I must believe in something, so I'll make myself believe it </l>
          <l>That this night will never go</l>
