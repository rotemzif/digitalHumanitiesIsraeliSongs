        <head>Let Her Go</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>Well you only need the light when it's burning low </l>
          <l>Only miss the sun when it starts to snow </l>
          <l>Only know you love her when you let her go </l>
          <l>Only know you've been high when you're feeling low </l>
          <l>Only hate the road when you're missing home </l>
          <l>Only know you love her when you let her go </l>
          <l>And you let her go </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>Staring at the bottom of your glass </l>
          <l>Hoping one day you'll make a dream last </l>
          <l>But dreams come slow and they go so fast </l>
          <l>You see her when you close your eyes </l>
          <l>Maybe one day you'll understand why </l>
          <l>Everything you touch surely dies </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>But you only need the light when it's burning low </l>
          <l>Only miss the sun when it starts to snow </l>
          <l>Only know you love her when you let her go </l>
          <l>Only know you've been high when you're feeling low </l>
          <l>Only hate the road when you're missing home </l>
          <l>Only know you love her when you let her go </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>Staring at the ceiling in the dark </l>
          <l>Same old empty feeling in your heart </l>
          <l>'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast </l>
          <l>Well you see her when you fall asleep </l>
          <l>But never to touch and never to keep </l>
          <l>'Cause you loved her too much and you dive too deep </l>
          <l>'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low </l>
          <l>Only miss the sun when it starts to snow </l>
          <l>Only know you love her when you let her go </l>
          <l>Only know you've been high when you're feeling low </l>
          <l>Only hate the road when you're missing home </l>
          <l>Only know you love her when you let her go</l>
