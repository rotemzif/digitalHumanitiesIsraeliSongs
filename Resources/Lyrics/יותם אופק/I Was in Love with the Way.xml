        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>I was in love with the way</l>
          <l>you chose your clothes for the day.</l>
          <l>We were too young to pretend</l>
          <l>it was not a dead end.</l>
          <l>Did all the time that passed us by</l>
          <l>open the wounds you used to hide?</l>
          <l>Or are you still the strongest boy</l>
          <l>as strong as you were when she died?</l>
          <l>Do all the roads we skated on</l>
          <l>still remind you of the songs</l>
          <l>that placed our hearts inside a box</l>
          <l>labeled ‘before we got lost’?</l>
          <l>I was in love with the way</l>
          <l>you chose your clothes for the day, </l>
          <l>based on how bad they smelled.</l>
          <l>We were too young to pretend</l>
          <l>it was not a dead end, </l>
          <l>I thought you’d be there too.</l>
