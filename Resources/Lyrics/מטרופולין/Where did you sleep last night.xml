          <l>My girl, my girl, don't lie to me </l>
          <l> Tell me where did you sleep last night </l>
          <l> In the pines, in the pines </l>
          <l> Where the sun don't ever shine  </l>
          <l> I would shiver the whole night through  </l>
          <l> My girl, my girl, where will you go </l>
          <l> I'm going where the cold wind blows </l>
          <l> Her husband was a hard working man </l>
          <l> Just about a mile from here </l>
          <l> His head was found in a driving wheel </l>
          <l> But his body never was found </l>
          <l> My girl, my girl, don't lie to me </l>
          <l> Tell me where did you sleep last night </l>
          <l> My girl, my girl, where will you go </l>
          <l> I'm going where the cold wind blows </l>
          <l> In the pines, in the pines </l>
          <l> Where the sun don't ever shine </l>
          <l> My girl, my girl, don't lie to me </l>
          <l> Tell me where did you sleep last night </l>
          <l> I would shiver the whole night through </l>
          <l> My girl, my girl, don't lie to me </l>
          <l> Tell me where did you sleep last night</l>
