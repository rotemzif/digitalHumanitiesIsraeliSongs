          <l>Give me a reason, to forgive for all the pain </l>
          <l>and suffering you have caused </l>
          <l>Behind a mask of perfection </l>
          <l>(you) lie to yourself </l>
          <l>afraid to face your own flaws </l>
          <l>Just say "I'm sorry" </l>
          <l>Say that you're sorry now </l>
          <l>Say that you're sorry </l>
          <l>Just say that you're sorry now! </l>

          <l>Times have changed </l>
          <l>I'm here and I take a stand! </l>
          <l>Drive me away?! You'll never! </l>
          <l>Forever here to stay! </l>
          <l>Never again! </l>
          <l>I won't let you tread on me! </l>

          <l>Hate was the only option </l>
          <l>for those who knew nothing more </l>
          <l>And fate was the only answer </l>
          <l>for those who lost everything in the war </l>
          <l>It's unbelievable how sometimes </l>
          <l>one man's face can be so deceiving </l>
          <l>Ironic how (the) persistant search </l>
          <l>after the deliverance </l>
          <l>can make one man's voice be so misleading </l>
          <l>Just say "I'm sorry" </l>
          <l>Say that you're sorry now </l>
          <l>Say that you're sorry </l>
          <l>Just say that you're sorry now! </l>

          <l>on the roadside of life, as it were </l>
          <l>that every passer-by may see them </l>
          <l>Yet, because of their very obviousness </l>
          <l>the general run of people disregard such truths </l>
          <l>or at least they do not make them </l>
          <l>the object of any conscious knowledge </l>

          <l>They are highly surprised when somebody </l>
