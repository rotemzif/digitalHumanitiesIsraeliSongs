          <l>A broken sun-ray meets my window </l>
          <l>A few more moments of fading light</l>
          <l>Naked trees, the stars are singing </l>
          <l>Someone else's song tonight</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>I know your crimes, your guilty pleasures</l>
          <l>The lies you weave to leave tonight</l>
          <l>It feels so wrong, your heart is distant</l>
          <l>Cuz' someone else is on your mind</l>

          <l>I thought I knew you </l>
          <l>But the night was calling</l>
          <l>I was slowly dying</l>
          <l>I thought I knew you</l>
          <l>Love is blinding</l>
          <l>I never saw it coming</l>

          <l>There's no place left for me</l>
          <l>We're losing it all but you can't see</l>
          <l>There's no where else to go </l>

          <l>Beauty paints a perfect picture</l>
          <l>A blooming love for all to see</l>
          <l>She doesn't know your weak devotion</l>
          <l>But she'll find out the same as me</l>
