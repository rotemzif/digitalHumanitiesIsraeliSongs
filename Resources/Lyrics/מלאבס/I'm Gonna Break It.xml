          <l>I'm addicted to words you're addicted to fashion </l>
          <l>I'm addicted to you, now I'm going to bed </l>
          <l>In a way I'm concerned but I still call you baby and shake my head </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>I'm addicted to muse you are looking for problems </l>
          <l>Tell me when it became such an envy play </l>
          <l>If only I could pray, if only I could move </l>
          <l>I probably would </l>

          <l>You're going on and on </l>
          <l>I'm faking smiles and then turn </l>
          <l>You're going on and on </l>
          <l>Maybe I should go </l>
          <l>To other places </l>
          <l>To other meadows </l>
          <l>Find a new direction </l>

          <l>Today it's a game but tomorrow will be there </l>
          <l>And all I can feel is Agnostic waves </l>
          <l>You know I'm dying for a thrill but all I see is just empty spaces </l>
          <l>You know I'm trying this for real but all you've got is the same old look </l>

          <l>And now I'm gonna break it </l>
          <l>Don’t ask me why - you name it – you know… </l>
          <l>Now I'm gonna break it </l>
          <l>Why? You name it – who's bleeding after all ? </l>
