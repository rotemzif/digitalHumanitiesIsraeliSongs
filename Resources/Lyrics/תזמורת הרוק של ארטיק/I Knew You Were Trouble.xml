          <l>Once upon time</l>
          <l>A few mistakes ago</l>
          <l>I was in your sights</l>
          <l>You got me alone</l>
          <l>You found me</l>
          <l>You found me</l>
          <l>You found me</l>

        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>I guess you didn't care</l>
          <l>And I guess I liked that</l>
          <l>And when I fell hard</l>
          <l>You took a step back</l>
          <l>Without me, without me, without me</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>And he's long gone</l>
          <l>When he's next to me</l>
          <l>And I realize the blame is on me</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in</l>
          <l>So shame on me now</l>
          <l>Flew me to places i'd never been</l>
          <l>So you put me down oh</l>
          <l>I knew you were trouble when you walked in</l>
          <l>So shame on me now</l>
          <l>Flew me to places i'd never been</l>
          <l>Now i'm lying on the cold hard ground</l>
          <l>Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble</l>
          <l>Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble</l>

        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>No apologies</l>
          <l>He'll never see you cry</l>
          <l>Pretend he doesn't know</l>
          <l>That he's the reason why</l>
          <l>You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning</l>

        <lg number="6" type="stanza">
          <l>And I heard you moved on</l>
          <l>From whispers on the street</l>
          <l>A new notch in your belt</l>
          <l>Is all I'll ever be</l>
          <l>And now I see, now I see, now I see</l>
          <l>He was long gone</l>
          <l>When he met me</l>
          <l>And I realize the joke is on me</l>
