        <head>Tips</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>In a crowded room</l>
          <l>When the lights are deemed</l>
          <l>And the smoke is thick</l>
          <l>Your eyes are feeling tired</l>
          <l>And your ears can't stand the noise</l>
          <l>Someone creeps behind you and</l>
          <l>Kisses the back of your neck and</l>
          <l>You're sweating like a pig</l>
          <l>But you manage to smile anyway somehow</l>
          <l>And then I see you from the other side of the street</l>
          <l>And I push my way inside to tell you something insignificant</l>
          <l>About the worries of my day</l>
          <l>And you scream into my ear</l>
          <l>"oh, how nice to see you here"</l>
        </lg>
        <lg Chorus="yes" number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>In a crowded room</l>
          <l>When the lights are deemed</l>
          <l>I can still see</l>
          <l>The tips of your fingers</l>
          <l>And I shoot your name 'cross the room</l>
          <l>Just to hear the weightless echo of my voice</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>The girl with the big smile</l>
          <l>Is smiling a big big smile in your direction</l>
          <l>I'd like to shoot her in the head</l>
          <l>And then your glass is getting empty</l>
          <l>But you feel too tired to call the waitress</l>
          <l>So you say "would you get me another one please?"</l>
          <l>You say "well we might as well push this night</l>
          <l>To its end"</l>
        </lg>
        <lg Chorus="yes" number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>In a crowded room</l>
          <l>When the lights are deemed</l>
          <l>I can still see</l>
          <l>The tips of your fingers</l>
          <l>And I shoot your name 'cross the room</l>
          <l>Just to hear the weightless echo of my voice</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>I wish I could say we were two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl</l>
          <l>But unfortunately we were never introduced</l>
          <l>And when we meet I scream into your ear</l>
          <l>Everything but the one thing that I really want to scream into your ear</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="6" type="stanza">
          <l>In a crowded room</l>
          <l>When the lights are deemed</l>

          <l>The tips of your fingers</l>
          <l>And I shoot your name 'cross the room</l>
          <l>Just to hear the weightless echo of my voice</l>
          <l>Of my voice</l>
          <l>My voice</l>

          <l>And the smoke is thick</l>
          <l>It's four o'clock in the morning</l>
          <l>Time to rest your aching head</l>
          <l>We take a cab outside</l>
          <l>You drop me off for I need to be drunker than you said</l>
          <l>Call me next week is that a tear I see on your cheek</l>
          <l>Why do you always have to cry?</l>
        </lg>

          <l>'cause in a crowded room</l>
          <l>When the lights are deemed</l>
          <l>I can still see</l>
          <l>The tips of your fingers</l>
          <l>And I want to tell you that I've loved you long enough and that's enough for me</l>
          <l>It's enough enough enough enough enough enough enough enough enough </l>
          <l>For me</l>
