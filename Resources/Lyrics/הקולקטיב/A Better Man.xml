        <head>A Better Man</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>I hope you're breathing well and made it through the flight </l>
          <l>I hope you learn to sleep with all these flashing lights </l>
          <l>I hope your feet don't hurt, I hope they treat you nice </l>
          <l>I hope your teeth won't crack from chewing all this ice </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>I hear you lost some weight, I bet you're feeling small </l>
          <l>I hear you did not hear anything at all </l>
          <l>I hear you're already here and you're not letting go </l>
          <l>I hear and can see quite clear how it ends up in tears, how it ends up in so and so... </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>And please wake up a better man </l>
          <l>I know you want it too </l>
          <l>Turn the rust back into sand </l>
          <l>Please wake up a better man </l>
          <l>Or else just let me through </l>
          <l>I hope you can </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>So let the bed bugs bite 'till they blood-let the night </l>
          <l>And when morning comes, let up, let down, put up a hell of a fight </l>
          <l>Hold still, if you will, try to think it through </l>
          <l>Hold still - it's just a thrill, the joy of killing you're addicted to </l>
          <l>Hold still - for what you spill is best served chilled but has no use </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>So please wake up a better man, </l>
          <l>I know you want it too </l>
          <l>Turn the rust back into sand </l>
          <l>Please wake up a better man </l>
          <l>Or else just let me through </l>
          <l>I hope you can</l>
