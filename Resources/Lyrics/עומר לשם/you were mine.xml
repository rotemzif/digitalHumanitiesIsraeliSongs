          <l>I got your letter today in the mail You said you wanted to come back today I still got some feelings, still got some tears I’ve felt your presence ‘round me all these years   I can’t be angry with you all of the time I couldn’t stand you-not-being-mine But I gotta go my own way I can’t linger for you for the rest of my days   You were mine Till the end of time   I can’t decide on what to do I feel my heart has split in two I have given you all of me You gotta give something baby can’t you see That I still want you but nothing has changed If you don’t open up you can never be amazed   You were mine Till the end of time   I used to search the city for your face It’s real easy to fall off of grace I always had a feeling I would see you again Same eyes, same smell But we could never contain one another I guess we were wrong</l>
          <l>In being right for each other   You were mine Till the end of time</l>
