          <l>Who is like You in this living world,</l>
          <l>who is like You the heavens above,</l>
          <l>who will last for eternity, who</l>
          <l>created infinity. x2</l>
          <l>Shir HaShirim song of songs my</l>
          <l>own version, it is for You I long. I</l>
          <l>see You split the sea, listen please.</l>
          <l>Lift me up, dust me off, get me</l>
          <l>glistening crystal clean. Heat seek</l>
          <l>missling, to Your rhythemings.</l>
          <l>Different things implement in me</l>
          <l>persistently. The case is to face the</l>
          <l>place as close to face to face as the</l>
          <l>case will allow now. I bow down for</l>
          <l>no other, proud now, I represent my</l>
          <l>beloved, thoughts and feelings</l>
          <l>covered. Smothered, wrapped up in</l>
          <l>your blanket tight, warm belief at</l>
          <l>night. Every time is right. With the</l>
          <l>diamond like ring exchange of</l>
          <l>things, changed my being came</l>
          <l>from extreme feelings, became me.</l>
          <l>Seized control then You took hold</l>
          <l>who of my heart head body then</l>
          <l>you claimed my soul. Oh, it doesn›t</l>
          <l>end, eternity infinity, overwhelming</l>
          <l>y›all beyond outer limitary.</l>
          <l>Who is like You in this living world,</l>
          <l>who is like You the heavens above,</l>
          <l>who will last for eternity, who</l>
          <l>created infinity. x2</l>
          <l>I got this infinity infatuation that</l>
          <l>impacts the saichel, takes me long</l>
          <l>gone way beyond impatient. I can›t</l>
          <l>eat, can›t sleep, can›t breath, can›t</l>
          <l>bring my feet to where they need to</l>
          <l>bring me. Equally you reflect the</l>
          <l>best of what I project. Connect the</l>
          <l>head to chest, express tremendous.</l>
          <l>Without you horrendous, endless, I</l>
          <l>can›t defend this, this outpour</l>
          <l>relentless. Send the kiss then You</l>
          <l>bring me back. Three steps forward</l>
          <l>after three steps back. When we</l>
          <l>first danced You gave me whiplash.</l>
          <l>Double take to neck break, straight</l>
          <l>slave, I’m with that...admit that.</l>
          <l>I need You now, I breathe You now,</l>
          <l>I live and bleed You now, in every</l>
          <l>season now. Till the end of days I›ll</l>
          <l>chase Your ways like I run the race,</l>
          <l>olympic sprint just to catch Your</l>
          <l>grace.</l>
          <l>Who is like You in this living world,</l>
          <l>who is like You the heavens above,</l>
          <l>who will last for eternity, who</l>
          <l>created infinity. x2</l>
          <l>Ending: Three six nine, bless my</l>
          <l>wine. Everybody know they better</l>
          <l>recognize. Three two one, son of a</l>
          <l>gun when it all breaks down it is</l>
          <l>you I love. Six one three, perfect</l>
          <l>dream, everybody knows that Your</l>
          <l>moving me. Two four eight open the</l>
          <l>gate I’m moving in let me in Your</l>
          <l>space. Three six nine, bless my</l>
          <l>wine. Everybody know they better</l>
          <l>recognize. Three two one, son of a</l>
