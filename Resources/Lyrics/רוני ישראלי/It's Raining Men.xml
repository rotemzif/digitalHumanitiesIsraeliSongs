        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>Humidity's rising barometer's getting low</l>
          <l>According to all sources the street's the place to go</l>
          <l>Coz tonight for the first time at just about half past ten</l>
          <l>For the first time in history it's gonna start raining men</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>It's raining men Hallelujah it's raining men Amen</l>
          <l>I'm gonna go out, I'm gonna let myself get absolutely soaking wet</l>
          <l>God bless Mother Nature, she's a single woman too</l>
          <l>She took on a heaven and she did what she had to do</l>
          <l>She taught every angel to rearrange the sky</l>
          <l>So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>It's raining men</l>
          <l>It's raining men</l>

        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>I feel stormy weather moving in about to begin</l>
          <l>Hear the thunder don't you lose your head</l>
          <l>Rip off the roof and stay in bed</l>
        </lg>

          <l>God bless Mother Nature she's a single woman too</l>
          <l>She took on a heaven and she did what she had to do</l>
          <l>She taught every angel to rearrange the sky</l>
          <l>So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy</l>
          <l>It's raining men, Hallelujah, it's raining men, every specimen, </l>
          <l>Tall, blond, dark and mean, tough and tough and strong and lean. </l>
          <l>It's raining men</l>
