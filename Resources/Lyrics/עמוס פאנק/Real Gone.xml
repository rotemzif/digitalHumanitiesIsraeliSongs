        <head>Real Gone</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>You and I we used to ride up and</l>
          <l>down the country side</l>
          <l>I came from the east, you were</l>
          <l>from the west</l>
          <l>I picked you up I took you home,</l>
          <l>the radio played your favorite song</l>
          <l>You said hold me ‘till the sun goes down</l>
          <l>Come on girl, you shouldn’t worry cause</l>
          <l> in love there is no hurry</l>
          <l>We used to say 'forever and a day'</l>
          <l>I made you laugh, I knew I was home, </l>
          <l>baby, I’m never leaving you alone</l>
          <l>God, I hate to say that I was wrong</l>
          <l>All the songs we used to play, well, </l>
          <l>I don’t hear them anymore</l>
          <l>I’ve been trying to forget you, </l>
          <l>I’ve been trying to let go</l>
          <l>Real gone, but my heart keeps asking </l>
          <l>when ya’ coming home?</l>
          <l>Mornings racing black and blue, </l>
          <l>I was hooked and so were you</l>
          <l>Night time falls we’d paint the town red</l>
          <l>Dreams they come in shapes and forms, </l>
          <l>love has no boundaries where ever it roams</l>
          <l>I say I’m fine even though I’m not</l>
          <l>All the colors you have shown me, </l>
          <l>I don’t see them anymore</l>
          <l>Now every time I think of you, </l>
          <l>it makes me die a little more</l>
          <l>Real gone, but my heart keeps </l>
          <l>asking when ya’ coming home?</l>
          <l>Now sometimes I take a break, </l>
          <l>on the outskirts of town not too far away</l>
          <l>I like it there, but I never go inside</l>
          <l>I see her now and then, the more </l>
          <l>things change the more they stay the same</l>
          <l>Can you see us having a good time</l>
          <l>All the flowers you have grown, </l>
          <l>I can’t smell them anymore</l>
          <l>And I climbed up the evergreen, </l>
          <l>it’s so sad to live alone</l>
          <l>Real gone, but my heart keeps </l>
          <l>asking when ya coming</l>
