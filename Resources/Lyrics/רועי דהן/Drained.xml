        <head>Drained</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>You have been drained</l>
          <l> you don't think right you keep running with them</l>
          <l> so I call you once again but you don't see</l>
          <l> I'm not sure I intend to act according to your plans again not before the rain</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>And what if you'll get it lonely  I should have told you more but I couldn't hold the frame</l>
          <l> I've never heard you calling and I couldn't find the door</l>
          <l>You have a mean brain you don't speak right but you keep calling their names</l>
          <l> and the bigger it gets the less you see</l>
          <l> the rest of this emotion is just a substitute for your beliefs</l>
          <l> for your oldest grief</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>And what if you'll get it lonely  I should have told you more but I couldn't hold the frame</l>
          <l> I've never heard you calling and I couldn't find the door</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>You have seen fame you must be right for all this will pay and I'll give you everything I'll kill your pain I'm not sure I intend to act according to your plans again not before the rain</l>
          <l>And what if you'll get it lonely  I should have told you more but I couldn't hold the frame</l>
          <l> I've never heard you calling and I couldn't find the door</l>
