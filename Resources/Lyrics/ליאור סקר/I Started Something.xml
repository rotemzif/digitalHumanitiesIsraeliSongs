        <head>I Started Something</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>I've started something that went out of hand </l>
          <l>It's hard to remember just how it all began </l>
          <l>I was thinking of us when we started this game </l>
          <l>Each one so trusting </l>
          <l>Now things are not the same </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>Started to walk down the path laid ahead </l>
          <l>Never to certain just where we would be led </l>
          <l>Slowly but surly our skins we have shed </l>
          <l>a small voice inside me </l>
          <l>Has turned to me and said </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>Now I don't know who you are </l>
          <l>Now this has gone much too far </l>
          <l>Don't just drift on and on </l>
          <l>Don't let this game go on </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>We've started something that slipped from our hands </l>
          <l>Could be that is the way it will remain </l>
          <l>Could be that one day it will be again </l>
          <l>If we could just remember the way it all began </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>Now we don't know who we are </l>
          <l>Now we has gone much too far </l>
          <l>We will drift on and on </l>
          <l>And the games carries on </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="6" type="stanza">
          <l>But I could not see </l>
          <l>What was happening to me </l>
          <l>As the wind laid me down by the sea</l>
