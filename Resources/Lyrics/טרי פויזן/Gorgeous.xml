        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>"There's close to nothing left to eat besides of what has already been chewed. </l>
          <l>A 100 times before she took off from her chair down to the floor. </l>
          <l>look up a name.</l>
          <l>Its all the same.</l>
          <l>And when she's ripe, she'll tremble.</l>
          <l>No one knows just where she's heading for but she ain't stopping."</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>Chorus:</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>Cause she was gorgeous, and she was ready to do all of the many things a gorgeous would usually do.</l>
          <l>And she was gorgeous and she was ready to rule her whole existence in such gorgeousness no one would approve.</l>
          <l>But everyone would like to be ... Gorgeous</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>There's a little place inside her mind she keeps for all those gorgeous things she never said before </l>
          <l>she's saving them for times there needed more.</l>
          <l>look up a name.</l>
          <l>Its all the same.</l>
          <l>And when she's ripe, she'll tremble.</l>
          <l>No one knows just where she's heading for but she ain't stopping.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>Cause she was gorgeous, and she was ready to do all of the many things a gorgeous would usually do.</l>
          <l>And she was gorgeous and she was ready to rule her whole existence in such gorgeousness no one would approve.</l>
          <l>But everyone would like to be ... Gorgeous.</l>
