        <head>If I Were a Boy</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>If I were a boy </l>
          <l>Even just for a day </l>
          <l>I'd roll out of bed in the morning </l>
          <l>And throw on what I wanted and go </l>
          <l>Drink beer with the guys </l>
          <l>And chase after girls </l>
          <l>I'd kick it with who I wanted </l>
          <l>And I'd never get confronted for it </l>
          <l>Because they'd stick up for me </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>If I were a boy </l>
          <l>I think that I'd understand </l>
          <l>how it feels to love a girl </l>
          <l>I swear I'd be a better man </l>
          <l>I'd listen to her </l>
          <l>cause I know how it hurts </l>
          <l>when you loose the one you wanted </l>
          <l>cause he's taken you for granted </l>
          <l>and everything you had got destroyed</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>It's a little too late for you to come back </l>
          <l>Say its just a mistake </l>
          <l>Think I forgive you like that </l>
          <l>If you thought I would wait for you </l>
          <l>You thought wrong </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>But your just a boy </l>
          <l>You don't understand </l>
          <l>How it feels to love a girl </l>
          <l>Someday you'll wish you were a better man </l>
          <l>And everything that you had got destro   </l>
          <l>If I were a boy </l>
          <l>I think that I'd understand </l>
          <l>how it feels to love a girl </l>
          <l>I swear I'd be a better man </l>
          <l>I'd listen to her </l>
          <l>cause I know how it hurts </l>
          <l>when you loose the one you wanted </l>
          <l>cause he's taken you for granted </l>
          <l>and everything you had got destroyed</l>
