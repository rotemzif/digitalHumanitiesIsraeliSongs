          <l>I am sitting in my room, and waiting for surprise </l>
          <l>While you are sitting on a tree waving goodbye </l>
          <l>I am sitting in my room; you are sitting on a tree </l>
          <l>What a disappointment- It's just you and me </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>You are dabbing Vaseline on my dry dry lips </l>
          <l>I prefer the lipstick; co's it makes me look so chic </l>
          <l>You are dabbing Vaseline, I prefer the ventolin </l>
          <l>Tell me please oh tell me </l>
          <l>What "I love you, love you" means </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>Why don't you come with me? Why don't you come with me, why don't you want me? </l>
          <l>And If you'll fail to see that I'm in ecstasy </l>
          <l>And there is just one thing on my mind </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>Come on </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>You are making noises with my best friend in my house </l>
          <l>I am standing jealous, drinking whisky from a glass </l>
          <l>My pain is getting stronger </l>
          <l>It's so beautiful tonight </l>
          <l>I don't know if you realize </l>
          <l>What you're doing in my house </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="6" type="stanza">
          <l>Why don't you come with me? Why don't you come with me? </l>
          <l>, why don't you want me? </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="7" type="stanza">
          <l>And If you'll fail to see that I'm in ecstasy </l>
          <l>And there is just one thing on my mind </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="8" type="stanza">
          <l>Come on </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="9" type="stanza">
          <l>At the time when I was sure that we'd broken up </l>
          <l>I got you're funny letter, my oh my, we're getting back </l>
          <l>I am sitting on a tree, you are sitting next to me </l>
          <l>Holding hands together and waiting for the kids</l>
