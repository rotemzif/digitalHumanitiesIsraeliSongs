          <l>Faces getting cloudy, we haven't talked for weeks </l>
          <l>Something else gets you going now and it's not me. </l>
          <l>You don't deserve me like I thought you do </l>
          <l>In moments it could happen, but you don't let it. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>every place I go, it seems you're there </l>
          <l>and every walk I take, it feels you can follow </l>

        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>Almost everyone knows </l>
          <l>you made this like this </l>

          <l>Every walk I take it feels you can follow </l>
          <l>But it could be different, I know </l>
          <l>But you got so much to find out first. </l>

        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>And I can't be brave for you </l>
          <l>Fill your own tank of fuel </l>
          <l>And burn yourself down </l>
          <l>Just like you burned your friends. </l>

          <l>Our faces are so cloudy </l>
          <l>You haven't talked to me in months </l>
          <l>You got someone else that get's you going and it's not us. </l>
