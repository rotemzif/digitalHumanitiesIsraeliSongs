          <l>You disappointed me so much </l>
          <l>And It hurts me too that I don't love you any more </l>
          <l>And you, you took the wrong road </l>
          <l>You walked too much roundabout </l>
          <l>People thought you had something great </l>
          <l>But, no no no…. </l>
          <l>There is nothing great about you, you're just something else </l>
          <l>Cause I, I gave you so much </l>
          <l>And don't forget where you are coming from </l>
          <l>Strangers gave you things, there's nothing like the real thing </l>
          <l>And I gave you so much. I don't forget, no I can't forget </l>
          <l>And I'm that stranger too, sometimes. </l>
          <l>Cause I gave you so much </l>
