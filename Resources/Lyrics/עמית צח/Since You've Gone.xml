        <head>Since You've Gone</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>Tears have been falling from the sky</l>
          <l>I took the rain home with me</l>
          <l>Everything I have tried to hide</l>
          <l>Everyone can see</l>
          <l>I’ve learned to keep you out of sight</l>
          <l>Locked in a box under my bed</l>
          <l>No matter what I try to do</l>
          <l>You’re still in my head</l>
          <l>I feel you breathing beside me but you are not there</l>
          <l>I try to reach you but all that I’m holding is air</l>
          <l>And the salt on my face</l>
          <l>Makes me thirsty for days</l>
          <l>I would walk under your sun</l>
          <l>And I want to be strong</l>
          <l>I would say I was wrong</l>
          <l>Cause nothing’s been right since you’ve gone</l>
          <l>Tears have been falling from the sky</l>
          <l>Wind is so cold I can’t breathe</l>
          <l>Silence is taking hold of me</l>
          <l>And it just won’t leave</l>
          <l>I feel you passing beside me but you are not there</l>
          <l>I try to touch you but all that I’m left with is air</l>
          <l>And the salt on my face</l>
          <l>Makes me thirsty for days</l>
          <l>I would walk under your sun</l>
          <l>And I want to be strong</l>
          <l>I would say I was wrong</l>
          <l>Cause nothing’s been right since you’ve gone</l>
          <l>I would open the doors to the sky</l>
          <l>By your wish I would live, I would die</l>
          <l>I don’t know how to go on</l>
          <l>Cause nothing’s been right since you’ve gone</l>
