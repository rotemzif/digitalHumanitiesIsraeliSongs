        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>Way back someone came into my life </l>
          <l>Approaching me </l>
          <l>Hey stranger do you have a light </l>
          <l>Found some matches he tapped my helping hand </l>
          <l>Someday you'll be thankful for this thing you've done </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>Obviously, so intrigued </l>
          <l>was an important deal to learn more about this </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>Seconds later standing all alone </l>
          <l>Where Broadway meets with Bond St. felt like chewing gum </l>
          <l>Fingered out as some unlucky guy </l>
          <l>Suddenly it hit me he was a mirrored I </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>Obviously, so intrigued </l>
          <l>was an important deal to learn more about this </l>
          <l>Half was he and a reflection of me </l>
          <l>Too bad for him his part was crying </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>Anomalies said got released </l>
          <l>Get us through different aisles </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="6" type="stanza">
          <l>Come and see evil free </l>
          <l>Meet the perfect person </l>
          <l>as we talk sensibly </l>
          <l>With passion now unleashed </l>
          <l>all the same have your doubts </l>
          <l>Call me one track minded </l>
          <l>Take control of your acts </l>
          <l>I guess you can't believe </l>
          <l>I know you're hurting</l>
