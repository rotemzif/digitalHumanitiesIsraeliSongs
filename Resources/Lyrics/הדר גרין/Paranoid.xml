        <head>Paranoid</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>I never seem to be on track hanging by a sadness line</l>
          <l>It's up to me to understand the ways that I can act some times</l>
          <l>I didn’t know you were afraid but I won't act a different way</l>
          <l>I think I'm running out of air I could never stand another hit</l>
        </lg>
        <lg Chorus="yes" number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>All the magic I feel is gone </l>
          <l>Never seemed to be good for you</l>
          <l>With these feelings I might be wrong</l>
          <l>I'm still paranoid</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>You're still a cloud of smoke to me that never clears or goes away</l>
          <l>I'm still a slave to what I feel the fog is now a cloud of pain</l>
          <l>I don’t know how to rid of guilt its burning every part of me</l>
          <l>I try to run but I stand still I just wanna capture what I feel</l>
        </lg>
        <lg Chorus="yes" number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>All the magic I feel is gone </l>
          <l>Never seemed to be good for you</l>
          <l>With these feelings I might be wrong</l>
          <l>I'm still paranoid</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>I guess I thought you were away to revile the secret code </l>
          <l>Set example for the world</l>
          <l>I guess I thought I'd be insane if I'd never see you smile</l>
          <l>If I wasn’t worth your wile</l>
          <l>I guess I haven't much to say but to scream out of my boredom</l>
          <l>And to never be back here again                  </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="6" type="stanza">
          <l>All the magic I feel is gone </l>
          <l>Never seemed to be good for you</l>
          <l>With these feelings I'm never wrong</l>
          <l>You make me paranoid</l>
