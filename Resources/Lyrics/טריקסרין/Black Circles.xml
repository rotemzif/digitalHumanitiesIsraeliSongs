        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>Bells were chiming, chiming </l>
          <l>You are not really so charming, charming </l>
          <l>You just happen to have a nice face </l>
          <l>Crows were cowing, cowing </l>
          <l>But I don't want just your body, body </l>
          <l>Coz it all leads to certain disgrace </l>
          <l>If the hand that you hold isn't moving </l>
          <l>And your man leaves but scent in your bed </l>
          <l>You just have to believe that it's over </l>
          <l>You just have to believe that it's dead </l>
          <l>And you go on your own way instead </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>Walls were falling, falling </l>
          <l>But I never heard you calling, calling </l>
          <l>Coz when you call you crawl down on your face </l>
          <l>If you're walking on eggshells and needles </l>
          <l>And you're sick of holding your breath </l>
          <l>You just have to believe that it's over </l>
          <l>You just have to give it a rest </l>
          <l>When your pillow is made of sandpaper </l>
          <l>For his presence is lesser and less </l>
          <l>Did you know you were one of my heroes? </l>
          <l>Do you care, you were one of the best</l>
