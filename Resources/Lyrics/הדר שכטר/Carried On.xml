        <head>Carried On</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>Your intentions were always quite crossed </l>
          <l>I knew exactly what you wanted </l>
          <l>And now it's clear </l>
          <l>That the love I got was soon to disappear </l>
          <l>My love was blemished by your egoistic ways </l>
          <l>Of keeping me near </l>
          <l>And it's no shame to admit that you are my fear </l>
        </lg>
        <lg Chorus="yes" number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>But I carried on </l>
          <l>Even when love was crying out not to let you stay </l>
          <l>Carried on </l>
          <l>As my love was screaming at you go away </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>I know that the things I gave up will eventually take their toll </l>
          <l>And I saw you take the reins out of my need for control </l>
          <l>I came across as supernatural </l>
          <l>How silly that was </l>
          <l>And now I'm robbed from my powers </l>
          <l>Caught in your fire </l>
          <l>And all because </l>
        </lg>
        <lg Chorus="yes" number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>I carried on </l>
          <l>Even when love was crying out </l>
          <l>Not to let you stay </l>
          <l>Carried on as my love was screaming at you go away </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>I loved what we had when we were together </l>
          <l>Doing whatever </l>
          <l>Couples do when they're in love </l>
          <l>But I know you can't take it </l>
          <l>So I'll let you have it </l>
          <l>For a while </l>
        </lg>
        <lg Chorus="yes" number="6" type="stanza">
          <l>I carried on...</l>
