        <head>A friend in need</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>We met when we were just 16</l>
          <l>We hit it off instantly</l>
          <l>There was a boy sitting right next to us</l>
          <l>He vanished mysteriously</l>
          <l>We talked about basketball and foxy brown</l>
          <l>Wrote rhymes up on the wall</l>
          <l>You lost your mom</l>
          <l>I buried my dad</l>
          <l>You were the strongest of us all</l>
          <l>The strongest of us all</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>We met some guys through out the years</l>
          <l>We laughed about each and every one</l>
          <l>And when you came back from India</l>
          <l>Your heart knew it was done</l>
          <l>I met mine a long time ago</l>
          <l>That never bothered us</l>
          <l>But each year thats passed, you took a step back </l>
          <l>And I tried to catch up</l>
          <l>I tried to catch up</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>Yeah</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>And when you wore that dress</l>
          <l>You know I shed a tear</l>
          <l>It was like I was letting you go</l>
          <l>To the life you've always wanted</l>
          <l>So dearly</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>You were a friend of mine</l>
          <l>For some reason now you've gone</l>
          <l>And I'll be trying to catch up with you</l>
          <l>And your ridin' towards the sun</l>
          <l>Arizona sounds sweet and clear</l>
          <l>Maybe that's just what you need</l>
          <l>Just remember when you come back here</l>
          <l>I once was that </l>
          <l>I was once your friend in need</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="6" type="stanza">
          <l>Yeah</l>
