        <head>Jealous</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>She's having a baby on the second floor </l>
          <l>And you're in the living room waiting </l>
          <l>Waiting anticipating </l>
          <l>She's crying now but it won't be long </l>
          <l>And you wonder when your train will come to take you along </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>And you're jealous </l>
          <l>Jealous than you've ever been before </l>
          <l>You can't help it </l>
          <l>You've seen so much it hurts </l>
          <l>If I could I would </l>
          <l>Help you save your self </l>
          <l>But this battle is you own </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>He bought her a ring </l>
          <l>Just a year since you've been gone </l>
          <l>And you say he doesn't love her </l>
          <l>It's just for show </l>
          <l>And he cares for her like you know he cared for you </l>
          <l>But your ship never takes no prisoners </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>And you're jealous… </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>They won't let you be </l>
          <l>The Happy girl you were meant to be </l>
          <l>Always proving you on everything you've ever done wrong </l>
          <l>Where's that friend in need when you need it? </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="6" type="stanza">
          <l>And you're jealous…</l>
