        <head>killing light</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>I'll be following every step</l>
          <l>you know this town in small enough</l>
          <l>and we could meet by chance and gaze upon </l>
          <l>the sidewalks that wouldn't open up for us</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>and I'm likely to spend my days</l>
          <l>waiting in the house alone</l>
          <l>my medicine in hand, I'll make up a lie</l>
          <l>to make sure that I am comfortable apart</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>killing light could never seem to fix me,</l>
          <l>but I've had enough to try my best to defy it</l>
          <l>hand in hand, the never-ending story of your meaningless goodbyes</l>
          <l>resolved in a worry, a candle in your eyes</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>simplicity at best is waiting for an entourage</l>
          <l>it's only common sense to pick up a fight</l>
          <l>she's a belly dancer swimming in the flood</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>and it's a hell of a lot to say,</l>
          <l>I'm seeing through the camouflage,</l>
          <l>and we should know by now how to survive</l>
          <l>we're killing some, before we open up</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="6" type="stanza">
          <l>killing light could never seem to fix me,</l>
          <l>but I've had enough to try my best to defy it</l>
          <l>hand in hand, the never-ending story of your meaningless goodbyes</l>
          <l>resolved in a worry</l>
