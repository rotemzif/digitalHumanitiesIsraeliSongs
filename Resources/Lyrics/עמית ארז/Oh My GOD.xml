        <head>Oh My GOD</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>I'll sit in a train when the night is on </l>
          <l>look through the window </l>
          <l>straight at everyone </l>
          <l>and I'll know when they feel fine </l>
          <l>or just trying to keep their mind </l>
          <l>thinking "oh my god, what is that all about" </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>I'll borrow a smile from a guy uptown </l>
          <l>I'll borrow a secret kept from everyone </l>
          <l>and there's a girl who sits and writes </l>
          <l>you can tell that she's so uptight </l>
          <l>thinking "oh my god, what is that all about" </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>and the one at the side, </l>
          <l>he's an older man </l>
          <l>rolling a smoke with his tobacco hands </l>
          <l>probably thinking of his wife </l>
          <l>blaming her for messing up his life </l>
          <l>thinking "oh my god, I just could do without" </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>little kid sitting right outside </l>
          <l>staring at me, that's always how he hides </l>
          <l>and he knows the 'whens' and 'whys' </l>
          <l>and he never wants to say goodbye </l>
          <l>saying "I'm your god, you don't need anyone"</l>
