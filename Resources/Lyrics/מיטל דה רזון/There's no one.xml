          <l>Where did you go? </l>
          <l>when I've searched for answers in your eyes?</l>
          <l>Didn’t even look at me</l>
          <l>Where did you go? </l>
          <l>Wasn’t I worth just another try </l>
          <l>Baby don’t do this to me</l>
          <l>All that I was (baby don’t disappear) </l>

          <l>Promise I'll do the biggest crimes </l>
          <l>Tell the biggest lies just to have you</l>
          <l>Obsessed and I'll do the time for your love </l>

          <l>How could I choose? </l>
          <l>Self destruction is much too obvious</l>
          <l>Loving you meant hating me, oh</l>
