        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>my mama told me son since you were born </l>
          <l>I'm happy every day </l>
          <l>but now she says my son you're sometimes wrong </l>
          <l>you need to find your way </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>mama told me once a story of a guy who never failed </l>
          <l>but for me It never happened they just put me back in jail </l>
          <l>mama don't know what I'm doing here </l>
          <l>all those nights have been so long </l>
          <l>and I've been so far away I'm coming home </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>my mama told me son with all those girls </l>
          <l>you need to be o.k </l>
          <l>but now she says my son you need to know </l>
          <l>that sometimes girls don't stay </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>and I've met a girl so pretty she was tall with long blond hair </l>
          <l>she knew places in the city and we made love everywhere </l>
          <l>mama she told me that she loves me </l>
          <l>when my money ran she's gone </l>
          <l>and I've been so far away I'm coming home </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>It's now 4 o'clock this morning starts with clouds and heavy rain </l>
          <l>on the platform were I'm standing waiting up for western trains </l>
          <l>mama sold my songs for nothing on the streets I'm all alone </l>
          <l>and I've been so far away I'm coming home</l>
