        <head>King Of The Road</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>Since the time I young, I always thought about speed, </l>
          <l>So I took out my toy car, and I drove out to the highway. </l>
          <l>In the moment I got there, </l>
          <l>all the drivers stopped and stare in respect, </l>
          <l>I can still remember that my parents were about to collapse. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>I'm a king of the road. </l>
          <l>I am riding, I am riding -where you riding to? </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>When I came to the age I could register my license, </l>
          <l>I could see on the faces of my parents panic rising. </l>
          <l>All the shield and iron that they put on the car couldn't help, </l>
          <l>I put my hands on the wheel - and then </l>
          <l>I'm not out of control. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>I'm a king of the road. </l>
          <l>I am riding, I am riding -where you riding to</l>
