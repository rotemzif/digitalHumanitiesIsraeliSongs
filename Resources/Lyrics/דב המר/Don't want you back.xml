        <head>Don't want you back</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>Walking through town just the other night </l>
          <l>I thought I saw you just beyond my sight </l>
          <l>Spun around real fast, looked from left to right, </l>
          <l>Couldn't see nothing for the tears in my eyes </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>It's been that way for quite some time </l>
          <l>Ever since the day we said goodbye </l>
          <l>I don't want you back but I can't get you out of my mind </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza"/>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>I gave you everything but you wanted much more </l>
          <l>I tried to hold on but you wounded my soul </l>
          <l>Treated me so bad 'till I let you go </l>
          <l>But I still think about you when I'm alone </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>I know I was right to leave you behind </l>
          <l>I have no regrets most of the time </l>
          <l>I don't want you back but I can't get you out of my mind </l>
          <l>I don't want you back but I can't get you out of my mind </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="6" type="stanza">
          <l>When the sun came up my eyes were red </l>
          <l>My glass was half empty and so was my head </l>
          <l>You said one word as you shut the door </l>
          <l>My ears are still ringing with the sound of that "NO" </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="7" type="stanza">
          <l>Last night I dreamed that you came to me </l>
          <l>Asked to get back like we used to be </l>
          <l>Promised it'd be better just wait and see </l>
          <l>Woke up in a sweat, thanking god that I'm free </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="8" type="stanza">
          <l>I tell myself just to give it some time </l>
          <l>I'm happier now, I'm doing just fine </l>
          <l>I don't want you back but I can't get you out of my mind</l>
