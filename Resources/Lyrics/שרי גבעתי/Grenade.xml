          <l>Easy come, easy go </l>
          <l>That's just how you live, oh </l>
          <l>Take, take, take it all </l>
          <l>But you never give </l>
          <l>Should've known you was trouble </l>
          <l>From the first kiss </l>
          <l>Had your eyes wide open </l>
          <l>Why were they open? </l>

          <l>Gave you all I had </l>
          <l>And you tossed it in the trash </l>
          <l>You tossed it in the trash, you did </l>
          <l>To give me all your love </l>
          <l>Is all I ever asked </l>
          <l>Cause what you don't understand is </l>

          <l>I'd catch a grenade for you </l>
          <l>Throw my hand on the blade for you </l>
          <l>I'd jump in front of a train for you </l>
          <l>You know I'd do anything for you (yeah, yeah) </l>
          <l>I would go through all this pain </l>
          <l>Take a bullet straight through my brain </l>
          <l>Yes, I would die for you, baby </l>
          <l>But you won't do the same </l>

          <l>Black, black, black and blue </l>
          <l>Beat me 'til I'm numb </l>
          <l>Tell the devil I said "Hey" when you get back to where you're from </l>
          <l>Bad man, bad man </l>
          <l>That's just what you are </l>
          <l>Yeah, you smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car </l>
