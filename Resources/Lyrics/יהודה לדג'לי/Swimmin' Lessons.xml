        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>Swimmin' lessons are not expensive if ya know where to go </l>
          <l>All ya gotta do is keep an eye open - you will know </l>
          <l>Vodka, vodka and gin are a good start for beginners </l>
          <l>Move on to the rye and scotch when you think you're ready </l>
        </lg>
        <lg Chorus="yes" number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>I know what I'm talkin' about </l>
          <l>I know damn well what I'm sayin' to you </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>Sky-divin' is somethin' you should try; just find your sky </l>
          <l>All ya gotta do is freefall into your mind </l>
          <l>Find yourself a dealer, preferably through a friend </l>
          <l>Hook yourself up with some people who have been there already </l>
        </lg>
        <lg Chorus="yes" number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>I know what I'm talkin' about </l>
          <l>I know damn well what I'm sayin' to you </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>Comin' down is such a drag when you're high </l>
          <l>Maybe you should try somethin' else </l>
          <l>What do you mean by that? I hope you don't mean religion? </l>
          <l>Oh, don't worry I've already tried that two times </l>
          <l>I mean, get yourself some kind of inspiration </l>
          <l>Through artistic, creative pleasure </l>
          <l>And when you open up your heart to this idea </l>
          <l>Maybe you will find somethin' that you never knew was there </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="6" type="stanza">
          <l>Ohhh, I know what I'm talkin' about </l>
          <l>yeah now I think I've bin there once or twice before </l>
          <l>I know damn well what I'm sayin' to you</l>
