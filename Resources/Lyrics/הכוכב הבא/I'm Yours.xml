        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>Well you done done me and you bet I felt it </l>
          <l>I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted </l>
          <l>I fell right through the cracks, now I'm trying to get back </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest </l>
          <l>And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention </l>
          <l>I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some </l>
        </lg>
        <lg Chorus="yes" number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>But I won't hesitate no more, no more </l>
          <l>It cannot wait, I'm yours </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>Well open up your mind and see like me </l>
          <l>Open up your plans and then you're free </l>
          <l>Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>Listen to the music of the moment people, dance and sing</l>
          <l>We're just one big family </l>
          <l>And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="6" type="stanza">
          <l>So I won't hesitate no more, no more </l>
          <l>It cannot wait, I'm sure </l>
          <l>There's no need to complicate, our time is short </l>
          <l>This is our fate, I'm yours </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="7" type="stanza">
          <l>D-d-do do you, but do you, d-d-do </l>
          <l>But do you want to come on </l>
          <l>Scooch on over closer dear </l>
          <l>And I will nibble your ear </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="8" type="stanza">
          <l>I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror </l>
          <l>And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer </l>
          <l>But my breath fogged up the glass </l>
          <l>And so I drew a new face and I laughed </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="9" type="stanza">
          <l>I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason </l>
          <l>To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons </l>
          <l>It's what we aim to do, our name is our virtue </l>
        </lg>
        <lg Chorus="yes" number="10" type="stanza">
          <l>But I won't hesitate no more, no more </l>
          <l>It cannot wait, I'm yours </l>

        <lg number="11" type="stanza">
          <l>(I won't hesitate) </l>
          <l>Open up your mind and see like me </l>
          <l>(No more, no more) </l>
          <l>Open up your plans and man you're free </l>
          <l>Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours </l>
          <l>(It cannot wait, I'm sure) </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="12" type="stanza">
          <l>So please don't, please don't, please don't </l>
          <l>(There's no need to complicate) </l>
          <l>There's no need to complicate </l>
          <l>(Our time is short) </l>
          <l>'Cause our time is short </l>
          <l>(This is our fate) </l>
          <l>This is, this is, this is our fate </l>
          <l>I'm yours</l>
