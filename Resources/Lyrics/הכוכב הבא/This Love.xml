        <head>This Love</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>I was so high I did not recognize </l>
          <l>The fire burning in her eyes </l>
          <l>The chaos that controlled my mind </l>
          <l>Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane </l>
          <l>Never to return again </l>
          <l>But always in my heart </l>
        </lg>
        <lg Chorus="yes" number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>This love has taken it's toll on me </l>
          <l>She said goodbye too many times before </l>
          <l>And her heart is breaking in front of me </l>
          <l>I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>I tried my best to feed her appetite </l>
          <l>Keep her coming every night </l>
          <l>So hard to keep her satisfied </l>
          <l>Kept playing love like it was just a game </l>
          <l>Pretending to feel the same </l>
          <l>Then turn around and leave again </l>
        </lg>

        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>I'll fix these broken things </l>
          <l>Repair your broken wings </l>
          <l>And make sure everything is alright </l>
          <l>My pressure on her hips </l>
          <l>Sinking my fingertips </l>
          <l>Into every inch of you </l>
          <l>Cause I know that's what you want me to do </l>
