        <head>Careless Whisper</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>The careless whisper of a good friend</l>
          <l>To the heart and mind</l>
          <l>Ignorance is kind </l>
          <l>There's no comfort in the truth</l>
          <l>Pain is the all you'll find</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>I feel so unsure</l>
          <l>As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor</l>
          <l>As the music dies</l>
          <l>Something in your eyes</l>
          <l>Calls to mind a silver screen</l>
          <l>And all its sad goodbyes</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>I'm never gonna dance again</l>
          <l>Guilty feet have got no rhythm</l>
          <l>Though it's easy to pretend</l>
          <l>I know you're not a fool</l>
          <l>I should have known better than to cheat a friend</l>
          <l>And waste this chance that I'd been given</l>
          <l>So I'm never gonna dance again</l>
          <l>The way I danced with you</l>
          <l>ooh ooh </l>
          <l>Tonight the music seems so loud</l>
          <l>I wish that we could lose this crowd</l>
          <l>Maybe it's better this way</l>
          <l>We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say</l>
          <l>We could have been so good together</l>
          <l>We could have lived this dance forever</l>
          <l>But now who's gonna dance with me</l>
          <l>Please stay</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>And I'm never gonna dance again</l>
          <l>Guilty feet have got no rhythm</l>
          <l>Though it's easy to pretend</l>
          <l>I know you're not a fool</l>
          <l>I should have known better than to cheat a friend</l>
          <l>And waste this chance that I'd been given</l>
          <l>So I'm never gonna dance again</l>
          <l>The way I danced with you</l>
          <l>ooh ooh</l>
