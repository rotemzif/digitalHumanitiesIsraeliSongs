          <l>Seems like it was yesterday </l>
          <l>When I saw your face </l>
          <l>You told me how proud you were, </l>
          <l>But I walked away </l>
          <l>If only I knew what I know today </l>
          <l>Ooh, ooh </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>I would hold you in my arms </l>
          <l>I would take the pain away </l>
          <l>Thank you for all you've done </l>
          <l>Forgive all your mistakes </l>
          <l>There's nothing I wouldn't do </l>
          <l>To hear your voice again </l>
          <l>Sometimes I wanna call you </l>
          <l>But I know you won't be there </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>Oh, I'm sorry for blaming you </l>
          <l>For everything I just couldn't do </l>
          <l>And I've hurt myself by hurting you </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>Some days I feel broke inside </l>
          <l>But I won't admit </l>
          <l>Sometimes I just wanna hide </l>
          <l>'Cause it's you I miss </l>
          <l>And it's so hard to say goodbye </l>
          <l>When it comes to this, ooh </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>Would you tell me I was wrong? </l>
          <l>Would you help me understand? </l>
          <l>Are you looking down upon me? </l>
          <l>Are you proud of who I am? </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="6" type="stanza">
          <l>There's nothing I wouldn't do </l>
          <l>To have just one more chance </l>
          <l>To look into your eyes </l>
          <l>And see you looking back </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="7" type="stanza">
          <l>Oh, I'm sorry for blaming you </l>
          <l>For everything I just couldn't do </l>
          <l>And I've hurt myself, oh </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="8" type="stanza">
          <l>If I had just one more day </l>
          <l>I would tell you how much that I've missed you </l>
          <l>Since you've been away </l>
          <l>Ooh, it's dangerous </l>
          <l>It's so out of line </l>
          <l>To try and turn back time </l>
        </lg>

          <l>I'm sorry for blaming you </l>
          <l>For everything I just couldn't do </l>
          <l>And I've hurt myself.. </l>
          <l>By hurting you</l>
