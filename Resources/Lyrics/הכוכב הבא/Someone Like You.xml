          <l>I heard that you're settled down. </l>
          <l>That you found a girl and you're married now. </l>
          <l>I heard that your dreams came true. </l>
          <l>Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you. </l>

          <l>Old friend, why are you so shy? </l>
          <l>It ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light </l>

          <l>I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited, </l>
          <l>But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. </l>
          <l>I'd hoped you'd see my face &amp; that you'd be reminded, </l>
          <l>That for me, it isn't over. </l>

        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>Nevermind, I'll find someone like you. </l>
          <l>I wish nothing but the best for you too. </l>
          <l>Don't forget me, I beg, I'll remember you said: </l>
          <l>"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead" </l>
          <l>Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead. </l>

          <l>You'd know how the time flies. </l>
          <l>Only yesterday was the time of our lives. </l>
          <l>We were born and raised in a summer haze. </l>
          <l>Bound by the surprise of our glory days. </l>
