          <l>All that I have is all that you've given me</l>
          <l>Did you never worry that I'd come to depend on you</l>
          <l>I gave you all the love I had in me</l>
          <l>Now I find you've lied and I can't believe it's true</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>Wrapped in her arms I see you across the street</l>
          <l>And I can't help but wonder if she knows what's going on</l>
          <l>You talk of love but you don't know how it feels</l>
          <l>When you realise that you're not the only one</l>
        </lg>
        <lg Chorus="yes" number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>Oh you'd better stop before you tear me all apart</l>
          <l>You'd better stop before you go and break my heart</l>
          <l>Ooh you'd better stop</l>

        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>Time after time I've tried to walk away</l>
          <l>But it's not that easy when your soul is torn in two</l>
          <l>So I just resign myself to it every day</l>
          <l>Now all I can do is to leave it up to you</l>
        </lg>

        <lg number="6" type="stanza">
          <l>Stop if love me</l>
          <l>(You will remember)</l>
          <l>now's the time to be sorry</l>
          <l>(That day forever)</l>
          <l>I won't believe that you'd walk out on me</l>
