        <head>Imaginary insects</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>On days they had arranged to meet</l>
          <l>he would sometimes wake from a dream</l>
          <l>that he had been spread with honey</l>
          <l>and now could not escape the flies.</l>
          <l>Those nights they had agreed to meet</l>
          <l>She would immerse herself in cream</l>
          <l>She would win him with her softness</l>
          <l>And he'd be locked withing her thighs</l>
          <l>For hours after he would catch himself</l>
          <l>flicking them away</l>
          <l>imaginary insects.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>Why she was so hungry for his presence</l>
          <l>was a riddle "lady' he wants to shout</l>
          <l>'It's over can't you let it rest</l>
          <l>It's over can't you let it rest"</l>
          <l>For hours after he would catch himself</l>
          <l>flicking them away</l>
          <l>imaginary insects</l>
