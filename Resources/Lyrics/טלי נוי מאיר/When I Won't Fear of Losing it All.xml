          <l>Until I have met you I wasn't even aware that my heart was so badly hurt I thought I was just getting old or that there is no true love there at all  small hearts have hurt me so I've found a my ways to stay away  from burning emotions forgetting that pushing the pain away was taking the chance of feeling joy  When I let myself sink in all the good that is you When I won't fear of losing it all that is when I will know my heart is finally cured and its safe to let my feelings show  Silent like a cat  you sneaked slowly into my life and I never saw it coming but now it feels like you could be the one who holds the key to my heart   When I let myself sink in all the good that is you When I won't fear of losing it all that is when I will know my heart is finally cured and its safe to let my feelings show  So I raise a toast for the day I will let myself open in every way hoping the heat of the drink will melt all the doubts  and send them away  Now I let myself sink in all the good that is you and I don't fear of losing it all could my heart be finally cured is it safe to let my feelings show?</l>
