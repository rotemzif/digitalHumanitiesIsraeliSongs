          <l>You are my symphony of light" he said </l>
          <l>"In my dreams I always hoped I'd find my soul mate </l>
          <l>Let's take the road less traveled </l>
          <l>into this strange old love affair </l>
          <l>Or better yet – </l>
          <l>Come rest your head with me" </l>
          <l>He said before he left that day </l>
        </lg>
        <lg Chorus="yes" number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>Hold my hand, oh, no, don't leave me </l>
          <l>No, don't…please grab my </l>
          <l>wrist and I will pull you up </l>
          <l>Be my shelter, don't slip away </l>
          <l>I'll make it better, I promise </l>
        </lg>

          <l>He took her places she'd never dreamt before </l>
          <l>They always were each others' light </l>
          <l>, they didn't fight Everything was alright </l>
          <l>But he carried things he'd burried </l>
          <l>long long time ago </l>
          <l>They started creepin' down below </l>
          <l>"I love you so!" he said, then climbed on the window </l>
        </lg>
        <lg Chorus="yes" number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>Hold my hand, oh, no, don't leave me... </l>

        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>He was her lover, she wanted no other, </l>
          <l>She looked-up to him and he was </l>
          <l>her guiding light </l>
          <l>She believed him, she never deceived him </l>
          <l>But she couldn't keep him alive</l>
