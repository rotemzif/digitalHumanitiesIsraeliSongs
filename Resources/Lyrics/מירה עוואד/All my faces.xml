        <head>All my faces</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>I can see your eyes</l>
          <l>Cold and resigned</l>
          <l>Trying to glimpse inside the secret corners of my mind</l>
          <l>I can feel your words </l>
          <l>Judging my silence</l>
          <l>And I wonder if you realize just what you're asking.</l>
          <l>Would it be the same if I let you get in?</l>
          <l>'cause I would let you touch</l>
          <l>But not get under my skin</l>
          <l>There's more to me than what meets the eye</l>
          <l>It's not a lie</l>
          <l>It's just my way to get by</l>
          <l>You say you want all of me</l>
          <l>You want to see all my faces</l>
          <l>Think you can handle it?</l>
          <l>Think you can handle what I am?</l>
          <l>You say you want all of me</l>
          <l>You want to see all my faces</l>
          <l>Think you can handle it?</l>
          <l>Do you think you can handle me?</l>
          <l>I'm so tired of this guessing game</l>
          <l>You want me to give up my mask</l>
          <l>I'm not some pet you're gonna tame</l>
          <l>I'm not ready to reveal the parts that are hurting in me</l>
          <l>Although it's anyway those parts</l>
          <l>That you never seem to see</l>
          <l>You say you want all of me</l>
          <l>You want to see all my faces</l>
          <l>Think you can handle it?</l>
          <l>Think you can handle what I am?</l>
          <l>You say you want all of me</l>
          <l>You want to see all my faces</l>
          <l>Think you can handle it?</l>
          <l>Do you think you can handle me?</l>
          <l>You are right</l>
          <l>The doors are closed for a reason</l>
          <l>So you better not pry</l>
          <l>Out of reach</l>
          <l>From this human connection</l>
          <l>That is getting harder and harder to satisfy</l>
          <l>You say you want all of me…</l>
