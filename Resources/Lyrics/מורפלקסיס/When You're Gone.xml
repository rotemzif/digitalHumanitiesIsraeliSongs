        <head>When You're Gone</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>Separated here we stand Strangers in a foreign land, </l>
          <l>Trying to find out if we're really real. </l>
          <l>Two islands in the sea, Waiting for eternity, </l>
          <l>Taking what we beg, borrow, or steal. </l>
          <l>You don't know how I feel, You don't know how I feel, </l>
          <l>In the morning, WHEN YOU'RE GONE. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>Wonder why I look at you, there's nothing more that I can do, </l>
          <l>When faces stare at us all through the day. </l>
          <l>Try to tell you of my dreams, and life is much more than it seems, </l>
          <l>And I mean every single word I say. </l>
          <l>You don't know how I cry, You don't know how I try, </l>
          <l>To be with you, WHEN YOU'RE GONE. </l>
          <l>You don't know what it means, You don't know what it means, </l>
          <l>To be with you, WHEN YOU'RE GONE. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg Chorus="yes" number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>You don't know how I try, You don't know how I try, You don't know how I try...</l>
